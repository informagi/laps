However she was in a film with Robert Pattinson, High life (2018) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4827558/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_8_act). Which was well recieved, however i think Mia Goth has a smaller part so i can suggest a film that she stars in. I would suggest the first of a ongoing trilogy. The film is \"X\"(2022) (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13560574/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_3_act). I suggest this as she is the main star and seems to fit in with your preferences."

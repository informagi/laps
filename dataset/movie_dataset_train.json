After saying goodbye for Christmas at a London train station, they both make the same mad split-second decision to swap trains and surprise each other. Passing each other in the station, they are completely unaware that they have just swapped Christmases. Hayley arrives at a vast mansion in a small village in the Gloucester countryside to find a place where Christmas does not exist, whilst James heads north to a small semi-detached in Macclesfield and steps into the warm and chaotic pandemonium that only a large family Christmas can bring. When the entire country is blanketed in the biggest snowfall on record, our star-crossed lovers are trapped at the most manic time of the year. Christmas traditions are turned on their head, secrets are revealed, and family truths are told with hilarious consequences. The couple realize that there is an awful lot they don't know about each other. Will they be able to swap back in time for Christmas Day? And will Hayley and James' fledgling relationship make it through to the New Year?\n\nhttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/your_christmas_or_mine"

Well, I think that I have plenty to go on here, so in that case, below is my main recommendation that I hope you and your parents like! \n\nI recommend Joe Versus the Volcano (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099892/), it's a lesser-known Tom Hanks film but it fulfills all the requirements. There are elements of escapism and some wickedly funny scenes that will have you and your parents laughing. The brilliant Meg Ryan is in it too, and I'm sure you already know how good she and Hanks are together. Let me know what you think about this one after you've had a look at the trailer!"

To sustain human life, they must use interstellar travel to begin civilization in a new world.\n\nI believe this movie will fit right into your wheelhouse of favorite genres and allow you to focus on the interesting characters and complex narrative more closely because you are watching solo.

It is Snyder's first film based on an original concept. The film stars Emily Browning as 'Babydoll', a young woman who is committed to a mental institution. As she collects items she needs to escape, she enters a series of fantasy worlds where she and her fellow inmates are strong, experienced warriors. Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung, Carla Gugino, and Oscar Isaac also star.\"\nSource:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucker_Punch_(2011_film)\n\nIts IMDB rating is 6.0/10, but critics tend to assign lower ratings to action movies.

It's a movie about a music student who starts to attend an elite music school, specializing in jazz drumming, and his quest to become a great jazz drummer and win the favor of his overbearing professor, who is played by J.K. Simmons.  \n\nDoes that sound like a good movie to watch that on an airplane?  \n\nHere are some links with more information:  \n\nIMDB:  \nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582802/\n\nWikipedia:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_(2014_film)"

The acting is also superb, with strong performances from George Clooney and the rest of the cast. At the same time the movie's development is slow-paced, allowing the audience to experience completely Augustine's difficult reality. Moreover, the exploration of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world offers the possibility to reflect on the themes of human connection, redemption, and sacrifice. The Midnight Sky might not be for everyone for its slow development, but it should."

Another movie I would be happy to recommend is Insidious. It has less of a traditional horror vibe and is more psychological but still centers around spirits and the afterlife.

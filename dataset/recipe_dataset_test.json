You can go with a classic marinara sauce for a tangy contrast, or try a creamy garlic sauce for a richer flavor.\n\nI hope you enjoy preparing and savoring this dish!

With eggs, mushrooms, and spinach on the list and avoiding olives, I've found a perfect recipe for a quick and easy Mediterranean-inspired breakfast.\n\nhttps://www.themediterraneandish.com/breakfast-bowls/\n\n15-Minute Mediterranean Breakfast Bowls:\n\nEggs - These can be cooked to your liking. I'm using soft-boiled eggs.\nMushrooms - I like to halve the mushrooms instead of slice them for this recipe.\nExtra virgin olive oil - Use a high-quality olive oil to saute the vegetables. You can see my favourites here.\nTomatoes - Cherry tomatoes are ideal but you can easily use grape tomatoes or even cut up a large tomato into bite-sized pieces.\nBaby spinach - Spinach adds colour, flavour and loads of nutrients to this easy breakfast recipe.\nGarlic cloves - Fresh garlic is a great base for flavour, no matter what seasonings you add.\nHummus - You make use homemade hummus, or any hummus variation you like, or even quality store-bought hummus\nSeasoning - I used Aleppo pepper and za'atar this time (I've used other spices and things like dukkah before)\n\nCook the eggs. You can prepare your eggs any way you like. I went with soft boiled eggs but scrambled, sunny-side up and boiled eggs all work great as well.\nCook the vegetables. Season the mushrooms with salt and cook until browned. Add in the tomatoes, spinach and garlic and cook until everything has warmed through and the spinach wilts.\nAssemble the bowls. Divide the vegetables among 4 bowls. Add the hummus and eggs. Drizzle additional olive oil over the hummus if you'd like and then add your seasonings of choice.\n\n\u25a24 eggs, cooked to your liking (I am using soft boiled eggs)\n\u25a28 ounces white button mushrooms (halved)\n\u25a2extra virgin olive oil\n\u25a2Kosher salt\n\u25a22 cups cherry tomatoes\n\u25a22 cups baby spinach (packed)\n\u25a21 to 2 garlic cloves (minced)\n\u25a21 \u00bd cups hummus (homemade ahead or quality store-bought)\n\u25a2seasoning of your choice (I used Aleppo pepper and Za'atar)\n\nThis recipe is not only quick and easy but also packed with Mediterranean flavors. You can find the detailed steps here.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how it turns out! If there's anything else you need or if you have additional preferences, I'm here to help. Enjoy your Mediterranean-inspired breakfast!"

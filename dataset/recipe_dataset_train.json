I have found a recipe that should be suitable for you here:\n\nhttps://feedyourfamilytonight.com/chicken-and-stuffing-bake/\n\nYou can substitute the butter for olive oil and it can be cooked in 45min-1 hour.  Let me know what you think and hope you enjoy it! That's without the roast potatoes, but you can easily add those in the oven at the same time using store bought dairy free options like McCain Triple cooked Roast potatoes from Tesco (vegetable oil instead of butter)"

Line a baking sheet or dish with foil.\n    Slice the rolls in half. Instead of breaking them apart, I just slice them as one big piece and pull them apart after baking.\n    Mix together the mustard, honey, and mayonnaise to make the honey mustard. Spread the honey mustard on both sides of the bread.\n    Layer the bread with the ham and cheese. Put the top half of the bread on top of the ham and cheese and place the whole thing on the prepared baking sheet.\n    For me, the easiest way to make the Buttery Poppy Seed Sauce is to place all of the ingredients in a jar, screw on the lid, and shake until evenly combined.\n    Pour the sauce over the sandwiches.\n    Bake for 12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.\n    Serve warm."

I do recommend that you add a spoonful of olive oil, though. It will both slicken the pasta and add a slight tang to it's flavor profile."

Here it is:\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n2 pounds red potatoes (about 6 medium), cut into 3/4-inch pieces\n1 large onion, coarsely chopped\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n1-1/4 teaspoons salt, divided\n1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed, divided\n3/4 teaspoon pepper, divided\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n6 bone-in chicken thighs (about 2-1/4 pounds), skin removed\n6 cups fresh baby spinach (about 6 ounces)\nLemon wedges, optional\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\n1. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. In a large bowl, combine potatoes, onion, oil, garlic, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary or 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Transfer to a 15x10x1-in. baking pan coated with cooking spray.\n\n2. In a small bowl, mix paprika and the remaining salt, rosemary and pepper. Sprinkle chicken with paprika mixture; arrange over vegetables. Roast until a thermometer inserted in chicken reads 170\u00b0-175\u00b0 and vegetables are just tender, 35-40 minutes.\n\n\n3. Remove chicken to a serving platter; keep warm. Top vegetables with spinach. Roast until vegetables are tender and spinach is wilted, 8-10 minutes longer. Stir vegetables to combine; serve with chicken. If desired, serve with additional fresh rosemary and lemon wedges.\n\n\nThis recipe is super simple for a busy weeknight, And, even better, it's versatile! If you want more veggies, you can add carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, and even cubed sweet potatoes. Roasted radishes are always a treat as well! \nThe rosemary, along with the juices from the chicken, will season the vegetables to perfection. I recommend stirring the vegetables a few times during the cooking process to make sure that they all cook evenly. Line your pan with aluminum foil and cleanup take no time at all!"

Roll up then place in the baking dish, seam side down. Repeat with remaining Filling & Tortillas.\nPour Sauce over the Enchiladas, top with cheese, bake for 10 minutes covered (Note 5) then 10 minutes uncovered. Serve hot!\nRecipe Notes:\n1. You can just use all onion or garlic powder, if you only have one of them. Fresh garlic is not the same, however, as a last resort substitution, you can use 3 garlic cloves, minced, instead of onion & garlic powder. Saute in the heated oil before proceeding with the recipe.\n2. Tomato passata is pureed plain tomatoes that is not seasoned. Unlike crushed tomatoes, it is thick and smooth, like a thick tomato soup. In Australia it can be purchased in a bottle in the pasta aisle of major supermarkets (Coles, Woolworths). You can make your own simply by using a blender to puree canned tomatoes.\nAmerica: If you can\u2019t find passata in the US (it is available at Walmart, Costco), a great substitute is US canned tomato sauce eg Hunts (yes, I\u2019m such a food nerd I brought back cans to use for this recipe and it\u2019s a near perfect substitute).\n3. Black beans are commonly used in Mexican & Tex Mex cooking. It\u2019s becoming more widely available in Australia. It can be purchased in the Mexican or canned beans aisle in most major supermarkets, as well as Harris Farms and Thomas Dux. You can substitute with red kidney beans or another type of beans if you prefer.\n4. The refried beans should loosen as it heats and stir through easily. If not, add a splash of water.\n5. To bake covered, I just pop a baking tray on top on the baking dish. Otherwise, cover with foil.\n6. To make ahead, roll up enchiladas and place in casserole dish (can smear with sauce underneath). Keep sauce separate and top just before baking.\nhttps://www.recipetineats.com/beef-enchiladas/"

I found a simple 10 minute recipe for a \"Southwest Chicken Hummus Wrap\" that the person that wrote it even gave a few additional suggestions on other ways that you could prepare this to make it to your own liking.

If you don't mind a cold lunch, but still want something filling, how about this vegan banh mi sandwich recipe? https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/boxing-day-banh-mi\n\nThis recipe has a few asian elements like the dressing and the use of fresh, colourful vegetables. The houmous and tempeh make for a filling, hearty lunch that is healthy and has interesting textures! Although the recipe suggests the use of hot sauce to serve, this is optional and can easily be left out. The carbs in this dish are also balanced out with the inclusions of fresh vegetables and protein. What do you think?"

Here is a recipe that has no pork, is something people comfortable to making food for themselves and that can be made in an hour and a half that I have retrieved to help you:\n\nHomemade Pizza Dough:\n2\u00bd cups (300 g) unbleached all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon granulated sugar\n\u00bd teaspoon active dry yeast or SAF instant yeast\n\u00be teaspoon kosher salt\n7 ounces (105\u00b0F to 115\u00b0F) warm water\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\nsemolina and all-purpose flour for dusting the pizza peel\nPizza Sauce:\n1 cup pureed or crushed canned San Marzano tomatoes (or canned Italian plum tomatoes)\n2-3 fresh garlic cloves grated with a microplane or pressed\n1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil plus more for drizzling\n2-3 large pinches of kosher salt to taste\n\u00bc teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\nToppings:\n2-3 tablespoons finely grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese plus more for serving\n7 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (not packed in water) cut into \u00bd-inch cubes\n5-6 large fresh basil leaves plus more for garnishing\ndried red pepper flakes optional\n\nInstructions \n\nPrepare Pizza Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but don\u2019t worry.\n\nScrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together and begin to get sticky. \n\nDust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) \u2013 it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top.  After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. \nLightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl.\n\nCover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Proofing Tip: If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment. \n\nRemove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen. [If you are preparing the dough in advance, see the note section for freezing instructions.]\n\nPreheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone: Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550\u00b0F (285\u00b0C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not go up to 550\u00b0F (285\u00b0C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C)\nAs the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.\n\nSeparate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nAssemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a pizza peel, you can try using the back of a half sheet pan - but it is tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch circle (don\u2019t worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you should be able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.\n\nDrizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon. Using a large spoon, add roughly \u00bd cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a \u00bd-inch or \u00be-inch border on all sides. \nUse the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. \nSprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I\u2019ll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. \n\nGently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone. \n\nBake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Note: If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully!\n\nRemove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.\n\nServing Tip: If you\u2019re serving two pizzas at once, I recommend placing the cooked pizza on a separate baking sheet while you prepare the other pizza. In the last few minutes of cooking, place the prepared pizza into the oven (on a rack below the pizza stone) so that it is extra hot for serving. \n\nOtherwise, I recommend serving one pizza fresh out of the oven, keeping the oven hot, and preparing the second pizza after people have gone through the first one! The pizza will taste great either way, but it is at its prime within minutes out of the oven!.\n\nhttps://www.abeautifulplate.com/the-best-homemade-margherita-pizza/"

Lay the bacon in a medium nonstick skillet, put the skillet over medium heat and cook until crisp, about 4 minutes per side; place the bacon on a paper towel. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan, add the pancakes and cook until they are warmed through and starting to crisp, about 1 minute per side. Sprinkle the pancakes with some salt and pepper, and transfer to a small baking sheet. Spread each pancake with a teaspoon of marmalade, and top with a slice of Swiss cheese. Keep warm in the oven.\nCrack the eggs into a small bowl, whisk with a fork until scrambled and season with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Wipe out the skillet, add the butter and melt over medium heat. Add the eggs to the center of the pan, turn off the heat and swirl the eggs until they form a thin circle and are almost cooked through, 30 seconds. Flip the egg circle into a half-circle with a spatula, transfer to a cutting board and cut in half.\nTop 1 pancake (cheese-side up) with half the bacon, half the egg and another pancake.

Let the tea cool for about 5-10 minutes. In a medium sized mixing bowl place the ground beef, grated onion, panko, salt and pepper. Pour in the tea liquid then mix together just until combined. Do not over mix meat or it will become tough and have a tendency to dry out when cooked. Cut the meat into 4 equal portions. Shape each portion into a ball and then flatten. Make a divot in the center of the burger. This will help the burger cook evenly and keep it from being fatter in the center.\n\nStove top: Cook on medium high for about 3-4 minutes per side or until desired doneness.\n\nGrill: Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side or until desired doneness.\n\nIf adding cheese to the burgers, add it in the last minute of cooking, allowing it to melt.\n\nToast the buns with a touch of oil or butter. Place the burger on the buns with any and all toppings that you desire."

                        "message": "Good to know that you are interested in my recommendation. \n\nNigerian Chicken Stew with Plantains is a hearty stew made with chicken, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and spices. It's typically served with plantains, which are a type of starchy banana. This dish is flavorful, satisfying, and relatively easy to make\n\nBelow is the ingredients used in it's preparation:\nFor the stew:\n\na) 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces\nb) 1 tablespoon vegetable oil\nc) 1 medium onion, chopped\nd) 2 cloves garlic, minced\ne) 1 tablespoon ginger, minced\nf) 2 tomatoes, chopped\ng) 1 red bell pepper, chopped\nh) 1 green bell pepper, chopped\ni) 1 teaspoon curry powder\nj) 1/2 teaspoon thyme\nk) 1/4 teaspoon salt\nl) 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\nm) 1 cup chicken broth\nn) 1/2 cup tomato paste\n\nFor the plantains:\n\na) 2 ripe plantains, sliced\nb) 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\nc) 1/4 teaspoon salt\n\nInstructions below:\n\ni) In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.\nii) Add the garlic, ginger, tomatoes, bell peppers, curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\niii) Add the chicken broth and tomato paste. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.\niv) While the stew is simmering, fry the plantains in the oil over medium heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Sprinkle with salt and set aside.\nv) Serve the stew with plantains over rice.\n\nTips:\n\ni) For a spicier stew, add more curry powder or a pinch of red pepper flakes.\nii) If you don't have tomato paste, you can substitute 1 cup of canned diced tomatoes.\niii) For a healthier stew, you can use chicken breast instead of chicken thighs.\niv) If you don't have plantains, you can substitute another starchy fruit, such as sweet potatoes or bananas.\n\nBelow is a link to the video tutorial, I hope it comes in handy;\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx8oUKou2TM - by Judith Otieno\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!"

Place the spaghetti noodles in a pot filled with water (about a little over half full) on the stove between medium to high heat. Watch so it doesn't boil over if you place it on high heat. While that boils for about 9 to 11 minutes, cut the chicken into tiny pieces. Place a skillet with a few tablespoons of olive oil in it on medium heat. Place the small pieces of chicken to let it cook until pink is gone. You can use either 1 or 2 chicken breasts, depending on your desired amount!

# TODOs
- Add a description on how to use the model with the prompts (single readme + prompt.json file?)


# Models
The models can be downloaded from the following links:
- [Fine-tuned FlanT5 Large model (Recipe)](http://gem.cs.ru.nl/grad-pkg/flan-t5-finetuned-model-large.tar.gz)
- [Fine-tuned FlanT5 Large model (Movie)](http://gem.cs.ru.nl/grad-pkg/flan-t5-further-finetuned-model-large-movie.tar.gz)
  - This model is first fine-tuned on the recipe domain and then further fine-tuned on the movie domain.

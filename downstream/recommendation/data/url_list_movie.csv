Similarly, Pam Ferris (Miss Trunchbull in the original) was also offered a cameo but supposedly turned it down as it clashed with rehearsals for a stage play.GoofsEarly in the movie, Miss Trunchbull is referenced as having competed at the Olympics after having also been the 1959 English champion in Women's hammer throw. This was not an Olympic event until 2000, making it unlikely Agatha Trunchbull competed at that level.QuotesMrs. Phelps: Is it a bully? Because you know, the best way to deal with bullies, is tell someone. Straight away. They thrive on... silence.Crazy creditsThe Roald Dahl Story Company logo appears in the form of a golden ticket inside a Wonka candy bar (from Dahl's novel ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"").Alternate versionsIn the French and Thai dubs, the reprise for ""When I Grow Up"" is left in instrumental. Likewise, the Turkish dub leaves it in English.ConnectionsFeatured in EE BAFTA Film Awards (2023)SoundtracksMiracleWritten by Tim MinchinPerformed by Matt Henry, Alisha Weir, Stephen Graham, and Andrea RiseboroughUser reviews193ReviewReviewFeatured review9/10 I've never seen a movie musical with more respect for the source materialIf you don't like musicals, this simply isn't going to pique your interest. But for me, even with the cut songs, this is one of the best adaptations for the screen I've seen. The choreo is very reminiscent of the stage production, as well as the general ""vibe"" of ""trauma through the filter of a child."" I laughed, I cried, I sang along. The one star removed is for cutting a few songs, but frankly the songs that were cut would be tough to translate to screen. I think a lot of people are expecting this to be like the Mara Wilson movie, or the book. It isn't. The plot is the same, sure, but this is an adaptation of the musical.helpful•3222Danni-Schwartz90804Dec 25, 2022Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ18How long is Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musical?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateDecember 25, 2022 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited KingdomUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial NetflixLanguageEnglishAlso known asRoald Dahl's Matilda the MusicalFilming locationsBramshill House, Bramshill, Hampshire, England, UK(Crunchem Hall School exterior scenes)Production companiesWorking Title FilmsNetflixTriStar PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$25,000,000 (estimated)Gross worldwide$34,706,541See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 57 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosDolby DigitalAspect ratio2.00 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Matilda the Musical (2022) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

He felt he was treated as an equal, without people staring at him because of his size.GoofsVizzini mentions Australia's convict colonies during the movie. This may seem anachronistic since the movie has a medieval setting, but this story is fantasy not history. In fact, its being told as a fairy tale from a grandfather to his grandson. In the novel, this was just one of many (intentionally contradictory) clues about when the story takes place.QuotesButtercup: We'll never survive.Westley: Nonsense.

With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action, adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are beautiful to watch and the story of their love is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out in this story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some of the best lines in the film. Chris Sarandon is perfect in his role as the bad guy prince.The plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together and levels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of very funny catch phrases-  many of which are still part of my repertoire more than a decade after I first saw the movie.   If you like dry humor and fast wit, The Princess Bride will make your day.I have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it has become my 'sick day' movie because it is such a joy.helpful•36865robbijeanDec 8, 1999Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ24How long is The Princess Bride?Powered by AlexaWhat is 'The Princess Bride' about?Is this movie based on a book?Why did Vizzini kidnap Buttercup?DetailsEditRelease dateOctober 13, 1988 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial siteLanguageEnglishAlso known asDie Braut des PrinzenFilming locationsCliffs of Moher, County Clare, Ireland(Cliffs of Insanity)Production companiesAct III CommunicationsButtercup Films Ltd.The Princess Bride Ltd.See more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$16,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$30,857,814Opening weekend US & Canada$206,243Sep 27, 1987Gross worldwide$30,902,869See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 38 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby StereoAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of The Princess Bride (1987) in Spain?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

The juxtaposition of ghouls and goblins with Santa and his reindeer sparked his imagination.Goofs(at around 37 mins) In ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws,"" just before Lock launches Barrel across the room, Lock is singing and his words are aligned. But when Barrel begins to sing, Lock's lips are moving to the words that Barrel should be singing. Barrel's lips don't move at all.QuotesJack Skellington: [singing] Just because I cannot see it, doesn't mean I can't believe it!Crazy creditsNo credits are shown, except the company and the film's name.Alternate versionsThe special edition DVD version has never-before-seen footage of this movie and are the following:
Lock, Shock and Barrel (the trick-or-treaters) are bored so they grab some snacks and go inside their cage/elevator to watch oogie boogie torture Santa and Sally. And later, a thought to be dead Jack Skellington enters the lair by jumping on the cage/elevator with the kids inside and he scares them which can explain how he got inside the lair at the nick of time. Pictures of the scene were in the promotional booklets, postcard books, and storybooks.Jack's further experiments with Christmas such as having a illustrating ""Sandy Claws"" as a human/lobster hybrid.a deleted part of oogie boogie's song that shows his shadow dancing.a scene where the vampires are playing hockey with the head of Tim Burton, this was corrected and Tim's head was replaced with a Jack O' Lantern.ConnectionsFeatured in The Making of Tim Burton's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993)SoundtracksHere Comes Santa Claus(1947)Written by Gene Autry and Oakley HaldemanUser reviews640ReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 One of the best films of 1993, highly re-watchableI was a kid when I first saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, but I wasn't scared by it in the slightest - this world is one entirely of the imagination, and in a sense saying that the film is scary for younger children is something of a compliment.  'Nightmare' is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.  With Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell & Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he's grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O'Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack's vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.Much credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton's finest accomplishments.

There are a few things to keep in mind: 1) This was a Martin Scorsese film. Scorsese was fresh off ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and other such successes from less than a decade before. People were expecting a lot.2) It starred Paul Newman, returning to his character from ""The Hustler,"" in a sequel that was twenty-five years in the making. That's longer than the wait for the ""Phantom Menace"" prequel.Perhaps for those two (very strong) reasons alone, when ""The Color of Money"" opened in 1986, the critics and audiences didn't think much of it. It garnered decent praise from both areas but most critics seemed to agree: it didn't hold a candle to ""The Hustler,"" and anyone other than Scorsese could have easily made the same picture.After 19 years, I disagree. I think ""The Color of Money"" is not only an intelligent and amusing character piece, but an excellent continuation of a character we haven't seen for 25 years.First of all, Scorsese's direction isn't his best, but it's still very good. And he's definitely got the same elements going on as ""After Hours"" from a few years before -- his cinematography is identical and the dark colors and grainy '80s vibe are present in every frame. Likewise he's using the quick-cuts and zooms and iconic panning shots that he's known for. The thing is, Scorsese's styles just changed a bit during the 1980s (they even carried on into ""GoodFellas"" -- the night-time shots carry the same foreboding look as ""After Hours"" and ""Color of Money""). I think now, looking back, since we've seen more of Scorsese's films, it's easier to notice that this is indeed a Martin Scorsese film. A man who is constantly changing his directorial approach. (Just look at ""The Aviator"" for goodness sake!) Newman deserved the Oscar more for ""The Hustler,"" of course, but for what it's worth, Fast Eddie Felson's evolution is handled with care in the script and it's very entertaining (for anyone who's seen the original) to note the change in his behavior. It's also interesting to see the new cocky pool hustler, Vince (Tom Cruise), filling in the shoes of Eddie from a few decades before.If ""The Hustler"" was a great insight into the life of a troubled young man, then ""The Color of Money"" is a terrific insight into the evolution of this man, and the contrast between the young and the old. All adults tell us as children that they were just like us at one time, and we don't believe them. ""The Color of Money"" follows this principal -- in thirty years, we all know Vince will be just like Fast Eddie: wise and matured. And then he'll probably be coaching a young guy who thinks he's the king of the world. Will they make another sequel based on this continuation of the story? I doubt it. It's unnecessary, because as far as I'm concerned ""The Color of Money"" has already stressed the point. But you never know...Overall this isn't a great movie and I won't pretend it is. But I do think it's one of the better films to come out of the 1980s and had a lot more going for it than some of the critics gave it credit for. Film buffs should see it, especially those who loved ""The Hustler.""helpful•9024MovieAddict2016Apr 28, 2005Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inThe Movies of Martin ScorseseThe Movies of Martin ScorseseFrom Taxi Driver to Killers of the Flower Moon, see some of our favorite stills from Martin Scorsese's filmsSee the galleryPhotosFAQ19How long is The Color of Money?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 26, 1987 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesEnglishSpanishAlso known asThe Hustler; 8-BallFilming locationsChicago, Illinois, USAProduction companiesTouchstone PicturesSilver Screen Partners IISee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$14,500,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$52,293,982Opening weekend US & Canada$6,357,877Oct 19, 1986Gross worldwide$52,293,982See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 59 minutesColorColorAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the Japanese language plot outline for The Color of Money (1986)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

You get to see each of the monsters' unyielding powers and characteristics, and them battling each other is nothing short of edge-of-your-seat monster excitement. However, the CGI on the creatures were too dark at times, making the monster battles hard to see. It is also difficult to see the creatures' faces and reactions - just a whole lot of head-spinning movements and swift actions.The human drama was average at best, and the good guys vs. bad guys subplot was a major distraction from the film, I thought. Much of the evil doers' actions were overkill, and our protagonists were too preachy, save for Ziyi Zhang's duo doctor roles, which is a great nod to Mothra's tiny twin priestesses in the classic films. I also liked that the filmmakers incorporated Mothra's Song in this movie.But, as with much of today's films, there is forced comedy to lighten up the mood, courtesy of Bradley Whitford's St. Stanton character. His humor was extremely annoying and distracting, very out-of-place for the movie.With all the hard-to-see monster action to the distracting human drama, there is too much in the film to digest and makes it hard to appreciate the main point, which are clearly the monsters. It leaves little room to sympathize with the human characters and leaves you craving for more of the monsters.Grade D+helpful•3511OllieSuave-007Jan 25, 2021Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ24How long is Godzilla: King of the Monsters?Powered by AlexaDo I need to see the 2014 Godzilla before watching this?Who is the new MUTO in the film?Why did Godzilla and Mothra imprison Ghidorah instead of killing him the first time?DetailsEditRelease dateMay 30, 2019 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesJapanMexicoChinaOfficial sitesMonarchOfficial FacebookLanguagesEnglishJapaneseChineseSpanishAlso known asGodzilla: King of the MonstersFilming locationsMéxico City, Mexico(Zócalo)Production companiesWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentToho CompanySee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$170,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$110,500,138Opening weekend US & Canada$47,776,293Jun 2, 2019Gross worldwide$387,300,138See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 12 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosAuro 11.1Dolby DigitalDolby Surround 7.112-Track Digital SoundIMAX 6-TrackSonics-DDPAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

A return to masterclass from pixar and not only that, probably their best work outside of Toy Story 1 and 2. This film does deserves every bit of praise it has got and more. I will say without hesitation that if you haven't seen this film, believe me you should.Lets just start easy by saying that the animation is something other-wordily. We are beyond the point where anyone needs to express the fact that pixar's animation is gorgeous, but the fact is this animation is some of the most intelligent and dense animation I have ever seen. There are easter eggs in every single frame and more than that every visual element in the movie is well rounded and clearly thought out which makes the storytelling so much more gripping. Talking about storytelling, rarely does a film do visual storytelling so brilliantly. Five minutes into the movie I was in and I knew how things were rolling. This s really a lesson on how to think things out visually and how to use visuals to your advantage as much as it is possible, combining them to smart, engaging ideas.And now to the layers the film has. The deepness of its themes, the intelligence of its story, the subtext behind every action and word, the comedic touches, the insanely funny pop culture references, the poetic approach to joy and sadness, the emotional depth, everything, I'm telling you everything here is gut wrenching. There isn't one scene where you feel time is being wasted, there isn't one word a character speaks that doesn't feel genuine, there isn't one idea that is boring or unoriginal. This film is beyond emotionally engaging, this film gives you a mirror on which to reflect your life and think about it, but no wait it doesn't stop there, it also gives you the opportunity to laugh about it, that no matter what is going on there is also space for a laugh and for lightness. Wow.After a second viewing I have settled on the problem I originally had and can now honestly say this film really just has nitpick issues, it's truly a great one and definitely the best we've been given in 2015 so far. After my first viewing I was all enthusiastic about everything above, but I also was left a little confused by the mythology the film uses and wasn't quite sure it always fit. Upon a second viewing I guarantee that there is no such problem. The mythology is perfect and works with a solid and thought out logic that takes into account the chaos of life. What doesn't quite work is the fact that the film does have a few really minor shortcuts or conveniences that may stick out and I honestly wanted a little bit more of the control center room scenes and see some more of how it worked there, but then again I am really nitpicking.Incredible for me to say it, but I really want a sequel to this film, it's incredible. I want to see another two hours of the five emotions battling in out in the life of Riley and her further struggles, especially want to see the teenage years. This idea is truly amazing and special and it is so inspiring to me, I just really want a sequel to this film and that's the first time I've ever said that in my life.Trust me this film deserves every single bit of your attention and heart, it will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions and entertainment that is absolutely delightful and will also leave you thinking for days.helpful•8378Giacomo_De_BelloSep 21, 2015Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ6How can Riley have blue eyes while both her parents are brown-eyed?Why only five emotions?

The Producers is a 2005 American musical comedy film directed by Susan Stroman and written by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan based on the eponymous 2001 Broadway musical, which in turn was based on Brooks's 1967 film of the same name. The film stars an ensemble cast led by Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman, Will Ferrell, Gary Beach, Roger Bart, and Jon Lovitz. Creature effects were provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.
The film was released in the United States by Universal Pictures in a limited release on December 16, 2005, followed by a wide release on December 25. It garnered generally mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial failure, earning $38 million worldwide from a $45 million budget.[2]


Plot[edit]
In 1959, following the flop of the Broadway theatrical musical Funny Boy (based on William Shakespeare's Hamlet) (""Opening Night""), the show's washed-up producer, Max Bialystock, hires the neurotic Leo Bloom as his accountant. In studying Max's books, Leo panics when he discovers a $2,000 discrepancy. While shuffling numbers, he notes that, as a flop is expected to lose money, the IRS will not investigate its finances. He jests that by selling an excess of shares and embezzling the funds, a flop could generate up to $2 million. Max asks for Leo's help with the scheme, only for the latter to refuse (""We Can Do It"").
Returning to his old accounting firm, Leo starts fantasizing about being a Broadway producer (""I Wanna Be a Producer""). Leo quits his job and forms ""Bialystock & Bloom"" with Max. Searching for the worst play ever written, they find Springtime for Hitler, a musical written by an ex-Nazi soldier named Franz Liebkind. To acquire Franz's rights to the musical, they perform Hitler's favorite song and swear the sacred ""Siegfried Oath"" to him (""Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop"").
Next, Max and Leo meet with failing, transvestite director Roger De Bris and his assistant Carmen Ghia. Roger is reluctant to direct, but when Max and Leo suggest he could win a Tony Award, he agrees on the condition that the play be more ""gay"" (""Keep It Gay""). Back at their office, a Swedish woman named Ulla appears to audition. Although Leo points out that they have not started casting, Max hires her as their secretary until they audition her later (""When You've Got It, Flaunt It"").
To gain backers to fund the musical, Max has dalliances with several elderly women (""Along Came Bialy""), allowing him to raise the $2 million. Leo laments about the dangers of sex distracting him from his work, and shares a kiss with Ulla (""That Face""). At auditions for the role of Hitler, Franz, angered at a performer's rendition of a German song, storms the stage and performs it himself (""Haben Sie gehört das Deutsche Band?""). Based on the performance, Max hires Franz to play Hitler.
On opening night, as the cast and crew prepare to go on stage, Leo wishes everyone good luck, to which everyone warns it is bad luck to say ""good luck"" on opening night, and that the correct phrase is to say ""break a leg"" (""You Never Say Good Luck on Opening Night""). Franz leaves to prepare and literally breaks his leg in a fall. Max enlists Roger to perform the role in his place, and Roger accepts.
As the show opens, the audience is horrified at the first song (""Springtime for Hitler""), and people begin leaving out of disgust until Roger enters as Hitler (""Heil Myself""). Roger, playing Hitler very flamboyantly, causes the audience to misinterpret the play as satire, resulting in the show becoming a smash. Terrified the IRS will learn of their crimes, a dispute breaks out between Max and Leo, but stops when Roger and Carmen come into the office to congratulate them. Furious at Roger for making the play successful, Max angrily confronts Roger for his actions, and even goes as far to physically torture Carmen when he tries to defend Roger. Franz then appears and attempts to shoot all four of them for breaking the Siegfried Oath by mocking Hitler, only to attract the police. As Max and Franz attempt to evade the police, Franz breaks his other leg.
Arrested for his tax fraud, Max is imprisoned while Leo elopes with Ulla to Rio de Janeiro (""Betrayed""). About to be sentenced, Max is saved by Leo, who returns to defend him (""'Til Him""). The judge, realizing Max and Leo are inseparable, sentences them both to five years at Sing Sing Prison with Franz. Writing and producing a new musical in prison (""Prisoners of Love""), Leo, Max, and Franz are pardoned by the governor for their work, allowing them to collaborate with Roger and Ulla and release Prisoners of Love. The play's success means Max and Leo go on to become successful Broadway producers.
In a post-credits scene, the cast sings ""Goodbye!"", telling the audience to leave the theater.

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]
The film grossed $19 million at the box office in North America and another $18 million overseas, which brings the worldwide total of $38 million. The film’s failure was partly due to its competition with King Kong, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Fun with Dick and Jane, and Memoirs of a Geisha.

Critical response[edit]
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Despite the rich source material, The Producers has a stale, stagy feel more suited to the theater than the big screen."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.[4]
A positive review from Betty Jo Tucker of Reel Talk said: ""Outrageous musical numbers evoke most of the laughs in this movie funfest. Eat your heart out, Rockettes, because here comes a little old ladies' chorus line ('Along Came Bialy') to rival your success. Watch out, real-life producers, for an actor named Gary Beach ('Heil Myself'). Never, and I mean never, hire him if you want your play to flop! And stop spinning in your grave, Florenz Ziegfeld. Those 'Springtime for Hitler and Germany' showgirls are all in good fun. Finally, congratulations to director Susan Stroman, for making this Broadway gem into a film that old-time movie musical fans like me can cheer about.""[5]
Nathan Rabin wrote: ""Between the rough start and an ending that lingers too long, there's a solid hour or so of terrific entertainment that serves as both a giddy tribute to Broadway musicals and a parody thereof. Thirty-seven years after Brooks declared war on taste and propriety, The Producers has lost its power to shock or offend, but it's retained its ability to amuse.""[6]
Roger Ebert cited difficulty in reviewing the film due to familiarity with the original 1967 film. However, he did state that the new version was ""fun"" and gave it three out of four stars. Said Ebert: ""The new movie is a success, that I know. How much of a success, I cannot be sure.""[7]
In addition to these positive reviews, it was nominated for four Golden Globes (including nominations for actors Ferrell and Lane).
Most negative reviews suggested that the performances were tuned more for the theater rather than for film. Stephanie Zacharek observed: ""The Producers is essentially a filmed version of a stage play, in which none of the characters' expressions or line readings have been scaled down to make sense on-screen. Every gesture is played out as if the actors were 20 feet away in real life, which means that, by the time the performers are magnified on the big screen, they're practically sitting in your lap. The effect is something like watching a 3-D IMAX film without the special glasses.""[8]
In addition to these negative reviews, it was nominated for five Stinkers Bad Movie Awards (Worst Director, Worst Remake, Worst Actor for Broderick, Least Dynamic Duo for Broderick and Lane, and Worst Song for ""Keep It Gay"") along with winning a special ""Annie Award"", which criticised the decision to sell tickets for the film for an additional $2.50; the name reflects a decision similarly used by the film Annie.

Jimmy Kimmel Live sketch[edit]
On February 28, 2016, a five-minute short film serving as a sequel to The Producers, entitled Trumped, was released on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprising their roles as Max Bialystock and Leopold ""Leo"" Bloom. The film follows Bialystock & Bloom having formed their own Political Consultants business, which has since fallen on hard times. Bloom realises that under the right circumstances more money can be made from a losing candidate than from a winner. They choose Donald Trump as a candidate, only for him to become a political phenomenon.[9]

The Producers is a 1967 American satirical black comedy film written and directed by Mel Brooks and starring Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Dick Shawn, and Kenneth Mars. The film is about a theater producer and his accountant who scheme to get rich by fraudulently overselling interests in a stage musical purposely designed to fail. They find a script celebrating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and bring it to the stage. Because of this theme, The Producers was controversial from the start[8][9] and received mixed reviews. It became a cult film[10] and found a more positive critical reception later.
The Producers was Brooks's directorial debut.[11] For the film, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant""[12] and placed eleventh on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list. It was later adapted by Brooks and Thomas Meehan as a stage musical, which itself was adapted into a film.


Plot[edit]
Max Bialystock is an aging Broadway producer whose career has veered from great success to the depths of near failure. He now ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence, while romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women in exchange for money for a ""next play"" that may never be produced. Accountant Leopold ""Leo"" Bloom, a nervous young man prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to audit his accounts and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, Leo realizes that, as a flop is expected to lose money, the IRS will not investigate its finances, so a producer could earn more from a flop than from a hit by overselling interests and embezzling the funds. For this same reason, no duped investor will be aware of the many others, thus protecting the pair from charges of fraud. Max instantly puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max convinces him that his current drab existence is no better than prison.
The partners find the ideal play for their scheme: Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden: a genuine ""love letter to Hitler"" written by deranged ex-Nazi soldier Franz Liebkind. Max and Leo bond with Liebkind over Schnapps, and tell him they want to show the world a positive representation of Hitler. Now with the stage rights, Max sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors and immediately starts using the money on fixing his office and hiring Ulla, a beautiful Swedish receptionist. To guarantee the show's failure, they hire Roger De Bris, a flamboyant transvestite director whose plays ""close on the first day of rehearsal."" The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic but barely coherent hippie named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known, in a reference to the counterculture drug, as L. S. D., who mistakenly wandered into the theater during the casting call. At the theater on opening night, Max tries to ensure a truly terrible review by attempting to bribe the critic who came to see the show. As expected, the man is outraged and hurls the money Max wrapped around the tickets he gave him at Max's feet.
The play opens with a lavish production of the title song, ""Springtime for Hitler"", which celebrates Nazi Germany conquering Europe (""Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for Poland and France""). The audience is horrified and rises en masse after the number, while Max and Leo sneak away. L.S.D. then comes on stage as Hitler, and his beatnik-like portrayal of Hitler reveals that De Bris has altered the script and directed the play as a satire. Franz drops the curtain, rushes out on stage, and furiously rants to the audience about the treatment of his beloved play. He is knocked out and removed from the stage, and the audience assumes that his rant was part of the act. To Max and Leo's shock and horror, Springtime for Hitler is declared a comic smash hit, so their investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out.
A gun-wielding Franz confronts Max and Leo. He tries first to shoot them, and then himself, but runs out of bullets. Max convinces Franz to take out his anger on the cast and crew, but Leo objects to it. The three then decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are caught in the explosion and arrested. At the trial, where they are found ""incredibly guilty"" by the jury, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for being his friend and changing his life. Max tells the judge that they have learned their lesson.
Max, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary and produce and direct a new musical called Prisoners of Love, which they sincerely want to be successful despite low production values. While Max and Franz earnestly supervise rehearsals, Leo continues their old scam—overselling shares of the play to their fellow prisoners, and even to the warden.

Production[edit]
I was never crazy about Hitler ... If you stand on a soapbox and trade rhetoric with a dictator you never win ... That's what they do so well: they seduce people. But if you ridicule them, bring them down with laughter, they can't win. You show how crazy they are.— Mel Brooks, in an August 2001 interview[13]
Writing and development[edit]
The title Springtime for Hitler was first coined by  Brooks as a joke during the press conference for All American in 1962. Shortly afterwards, he also decided to relate this title to a character named Leo Bloom, an homage to Leopold Bloom, protagonist of James Joyce's Ulysses.[14] It was reused by him years later once he had an idea about ""two schnooks on Broadway who set out to produce a flop and swindle the backers"".[15] The inspiration was some people Brooks met during his early show business days: Benjamin Kutcher, a New York producer who financed his plays by sleeping with elderly women, became the basis for Max Bialystock,[16] and the scheme had origins in two theater producers who had a lavish lifestyle while making various unsuccessful plays. When imagining what play ""would have people packing up and leaving the theatre even before the first act is over"", Brooks decided to combine Adolf Hitler and a musical.[6] Brooks, in a 2001 episode of 60 Minutes, stated that, while serving in the army, he was called ""Jew boy"", and he lightheartedly admitted that he made The Producers to ""get even"" with antisemites, particularly Hitler.[17] In another interview, he further explained his reasoning, stating,

More than anything the great Holocaust by the Nazis is probably the great outrage of the 20th century. There is nothing to compare with it. And ... so what can I do about it? If I get on the soapbox and wax eloquently, it'll be blown away in the wind, but if I do Springtime for Hitler it'll never be forgotten. I think you can bring down totalitarian governments faster by using ridicule than you can with invective.[18]
Brooks first envisioned his story as a novel, and changed it to a play when publishers told him it had ""too much dialogue. Not enough narrative"".[citation needed][19] He wrote the script in nine months, with the help of secretary Alfa-Betty Olsen.[15] During the process, he mentioned in an October 1966 interview with Playboy that he was working on Springtime for Hitler, ""a play within a play, or a play within a film – I haven't decided yet"".[20] Then, it evolved into a screenplay to take advantage of various settings, as ""it could go places, it wouldn’t have to stay in the office"".[14]
As Brooks sought backers for his 30-page film treatment, both major film studios and independent filmmakers rejected Springtime for Hitler, finding the idea of using Hitler for comedy outrageous and tasteless (with some even stating that they would consider the script if Brooks changed it to Springtime for Mussolini).[14] This changed as Brooks's agent arranged him to have a meeting with a friend of his, New York producer Sidney Glazier. Glazier laughed so much at Brooks' performance of the script, he accepted the project by saying, ""We’re gonna make it! I don't know how, but we're gonna make this movie!""[21]
Glazier budgeted the film at $1 million, and sought financiers. Half the money came from philanthropist Louis Wolfson, who liked the idea of laughing at a dictator,[6] and the remainder, along with the distribution, was arranged by Joseph E. Levine of Embassy Pictures. Levine's only condition was to change the title, as he felt many distributors would not carry a picture named Springtime for Hitler.[21] Brooks renamed it The Producers, considering it ironic as ""these guys are anything but producers"".[22] As Brooks ""couldn't think of anybody to direct it"", eventually he decided to take the task for himself, even though he himself had only directed one play before.[15] While Levine was insecure in having an inexperienced director, Brooks convinced him by saying it would be cost-effective, and he knew how to do physical comedy after being a stage manager in Your Show of Shows.[22][21]

Casting[edit]
Brooks wanted Samuel ""Zero"" Mostel as Max Bialystock, feeling he was an energetic actor who could convey such an egotistical character.[22] Glazier sent the script to Mostel's lawyer, but the attorney hated it and never showed it to the actor. Eventually, Brooks had to send the script through Mostel's wife Kathryn Harkin. While Mostel did not like the prospect of playing ""a Jewish producer going to bed with old women on the brink of the grave"", his wife liked the script so much, she eventually convinced him to accept the role.[14][21]
Gene Wilder met Brooks in 1963, as Wilder performed with Brooks' then-girlfriend Anne Bancroft in a stage adaptation of Mother Courage. Wilder complained that the audience was laughing at his serious performance, and Brooks replied that Wilder was ""a natural comic, you look like Harpo Marx"", and said he would cast him as Leo Bloom once he finished the then-titled Springtime for Hitler.[21] When production arrived, Peter Sellers accepted an invitation to play Leo Bloom, but he never contacted again, so Brooks remembered Wilder, who was about to make his film debut in Bonnie and Clyde.[22] Wilder received the script to The Producers as Brooks visited him backstage during a performance of Luv, and his co-star Renée Taylor was brought for a brief appearance as the actress playing Eva Braun.[14]
Dustin Hoffman was originally cast as Liebkind. According to Brooks, late on the night before shooting began, Hoffman begged Brooks to let him out of his commitment to do the role so he could audition for the starring role in The Graduate. Brooks was aware of the film, which co-starred Anne Bancroft (later Brooks' wife), and, skeptical that Hoffman would get the role, agreed to let him audition. When Hoffman did win the role of Ben Braddock, Brooks called in Kenneth Mars as Liebkind.[22] Mars was originally invited because Brooks envisioned him as Roger De Bris, given he played a gay psychiatrist on Broadway. Instead, Mars was interested in the Liebkind role, which became his film debut. He remained in character while not filming as a strategy of method acting.[14] De Bris was instead portrayed by Christopher Hewett, the first actor who read for the role.[22]
Recent American Academy of Dramatic Arts graduate Lee Meredith was invited to audition as Ulla on condition of being able to do a Swedish accent. She borrowed a book from the AADA library to learn the accent, and won the role with a screen test of the scene in which Ulla dances. Bancroft suggested her friend Andréas Voutsinas for the role of Carmen Ghia, feeling his thick Greek accent would fit. Brooks thought of Dick Shawn to play Lorenzo ""L.S.D."" Saint DuBois, and the actor accepted because he liked the part and currently had no work. Writer-director Mel Brooks is heard briefly in the film, his voice dubbed over a dancer singing, ""Don't be stupid, be a smarty / Come and join the Nazi Party"", in the song ""Springtime For Hitler"". His version of the line is also dubbed into each performance of the musical, as well as the 2005 movie version.

Filming[edit]
Principal photography for The Producers began on May 22, 1967. Filming had to be done in 40 days on a $941,000 budget, and Brooks managed to fit both requests.[6] The primary location was the Chelsea Studios in New York City, where the musical version (2005) was also shot.[23] The now-demolished Playhouse Theatre hosted the Springtime for Hitler play, and various actors who heard the film was seeking an actor for Hitler were cast in the musical number. The crew tried to film on location whenever possible, filming on such midtown Manhattan locales as Central Park, the Empire State Building, and Lincoln Center.[14]
Brooks's lack of knowledge of filmmaking had him committing many mistakes during production, requiring the help of assistant director Michael Hertzberg.[15] Being both inexperienced and insecure, Brooks started to have tantrums and behave angrily. He got impatient with the slow development compared to how quick television production was, temporarily banned Glazier from the set, berated a visiting reporter from The New York Times, and had clashes with cinematographer Joseph Coffey and main actor Zero Mostel.[14] Mostel also had a troublesome behavior caused by a leg injury received in a 1960 bus accident, which made his contract feature a clause dismissing Mostel from any work after 5:30 pm. Given the fact that the leg injury got worse in humid weather,[22] the last scene, filmed at the Revson Fountain in Lincoln Center, had Mostel throwing a fit and giving up on production. Glazier had to leave a dentist's appointment and rush to the set where Mostel and Brooks were arguing, and once the producer managed to calm them down, the resulting scene had to be shot all night long.[14]
Despite being described as a lavish production number, ""Springtime for Hitler"" was not ready until the first rehearsals. Brooks sat with Olsen and first-time composer John Morris at the piano, and improvised some lyrics. Morris then developed the stage performance with choreographer Alan Johnson, instructed to do the number ""big, wonderful, flashy, but terrible"". As Brooks kept suggesting bizarre costume ideas to enhance the burlesque nature of ""Springtime for Hitler"", such as women with clothes inspired by beer mugs and pretzels, Johnson decided to showcase them all in a parade.
Few scenes had to be altered from the original script. Leo and Max were to visit the Parachute Jump in Coney Island, but the attraction was closed by the time filming began. Brooks filmed Liebkind making Max and Leo swear the Siegfried Oath, where they promised fealty to Siegfried, accompanied by The Ride of the Valkyries and wearing horned helmets. But feeling that it ""went overboard"", Brooks cut the scene, which was restored in the stage adaptation.[22]
The art direction and costumes emphasized the color yellow, which Brooks considered a funny color. For the posters in Bialystock's office, production designer Charles Rosen found a collector in the Theater District and doctored a few posters to include the character's name. Rosen also incorporated an anecdote of his life, as he had to share a small elevator with a flamboyant Broadway director, to design the lift at Roger De Bris's house.[22] Principal photography ended on July 15, 1967. Post-production extended for months, as Brooks had gotten final cut privilege, but still had complaints with Ralph Rosenblum regarding his editing.

Release[edit]
According to Brooks, after the film was completed, Embassy executives refused to release it as being in ""bad taste"". The film's premiere in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on November 22, 1967,[1] was a disaster and the studio considered shelving it. However, relief came when Pink Panther star Peter Sellers saw the film privately and placed an advertisement in Variety in support of the film's wide release.[22][24] Sellers was familiar with the film because, according to Brooks, Sellers ""had accepted the role of Bloom and then was never heard from again"".[22][24] The film allegedly was ""banned in Germany"".[25] The film was screened in New York City in March 1968.[26] The film's wide release took place on March 18, 1968.[3]
The title of the film for the Swedish release uses the translation of the name of the play within the story, Springtime for Hitler. As a result of its success, most of Mel Brooks' subsequent films in Swedish were given similar titles, despite being otherwise unrelated: Springtime for Mother-In-Law, 
Springtime for the Sheriff, Springtime for Frankenstein, Springtime for the Silent Movies, Springtime for the Lunatics, Springtime for World History, Springtime for Space, and Springtime for the Slum.[27] The practice ended by the time Robin Hood: Men in Tights was released, at Brooks' request.

Reception[edit]
When it was first released, the film received a mixed response and garnered some exceptionally harsh reviews, while others considered it a great success. One of the mixed reviews came from Renata Adler, who, writing for The New York Times, stated: ""The Producers, which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way."" About the acting, she writes that Mostel is ""overacting grotesquely under the direction of Mel Brooks"" and that, in the role of Max Bialystock, he is ""as gross and unfunny as only an enormous comedian bearing down too hard on some frail, tasteless routines can be"". Co-star Wilder fares better and is called ""wonderful"", thanks to doing ""fine"", despite being ""forced to be as loud and as fast as Mostel"" and ""[g]oing through long, infinitely variegated riffs and arpeggios of neuroticism"", and playing his part ""as though he were Dustin Hoffman being played by Danny Kaye"". She also puts the movie into the bigger context of ""contemporary"" comedy and that it has the same ""episodic, revue quality"" in the way it is ""not building laughter, but stringing it together skit after skit, some vile, some boffo"". Her early conclusion, at the end of the first paragraph, is also a comparison to other comedic movies of the time, it reads: ""[The Producers] is less delicate than Lenny Bruce, less funny than Dr. Strangelove, but much funnier than The Loved One or What's New Pussycat?""[5]
The more critical and negative reviews partly targeted the directorial style and broad ethnic humor,[28] but also commonly noted the bad taste and insensitivity of devising a broad comedy about two Jews conspiring to cheat theatrical investors by devising a designed-to-fail tasteless Broadway musical about Hitler only 23 years after the end of World War II.[29] Among the most harsh critics were Stanley Kauffmann in The New Republic, who wrote that ""the film bloats into sogginess"" and ""Springtime for Hitler ... doesn't even rise to the level of tastelessness"", John Simon wrote The Producers ""is a model of how not to make a comedy"",[30] and Pauline Kael who called it ""amateurishly crude"" in The New Yorker. Kael went on to say,

The Producers isn't basically unconventional; it only seems so because it's so amateurishly crude and because it revels in the kind of show-business Jewish humor that used to be considered too specialized for movies. Screenwriters used to take the Jewish out but now that television comedians exploit themselves as stereotypes, screenwriters are putting the Jewish in.[31]
On the other hand, others considered the film to be a great success. Time magazine's reviewers wrote that the film was ""hilariously funny"" but pointed out that ""the film is burdened with the kind of plot that demands resolution"" but unfortunately ""ends in a whimper of sentimentality"". Although they labelled it ""disjointed and inconsistent"", they also praised it as ""a wildly funny joy ride"", and concluded by saying that ""despite its bad moments, [it] is some of the funniest American cinema comedy in years"".[32] The film industry trade paper Variety wrote, ""The film is unmatched in the scenes featuring Mostel and Wilder alone together, and several episodes with other actors are truly rare.""[33]
Over the years, the film has gained in stature. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 72 reviews with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""A hilarious satire of the business side of Hollywood, The Producers is one of Mel Brooks' finest, as well as funniest films, featuring standout performances by Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.""[34] On Metacritic, the film received a score of 96 based on 6 reviews, making it one of the highest-rated films on the site.[35] In his review decades later, Roger Ebert claimed, ""this is one of the funniest movies ever made"".[36] Ebert wrote, ""I remember finding myself in an elevator with Brooks and his wife, actress Anne Bancroft, in New York City a few months after The Producers was released. A woman got onto the elevator, recognized him and said, 'I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar.' Brooks smiled benevolently. 'Lady,' he said, 'it rose below vulgarity.'""
The film was a sleeper hit at the U.S. box office.[37]

Re-releases and adaptations[edit]
In 2002, The Producers was re-released in three theaters by Rialto Pictures and earned $111,866[41][42] at the box office. As of 2007, the film continues to be distributed to art-film and repertory cinemas by Rialto.[citation needed]
Brooks has adapted the story twice more, as a Broadway musical (The Producers, 2001) and a film based on the musical (The Producers, 2005). He did not direct the latter, but served as a producer. Unlike the original film, it was not commercially successful.
This film has spawned several home media releases on VHS, Laserdisc, CED, and VCD from companies such as Magnetic Video, Embassy Home Entertainment, PolyGram Video, Speedy, and Lumiere Video. A 1997 letterbox edition Laserdisc was released by PolyGram Video, which served as the basis for the extremely rare 1998 PolyGram DVD release.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns video rights to select Embassy Pictures titles that ended up with Nelson Entertainment and Polygram, released The Producers on Region 1 DVD in 2002 and reissued in 2005 to coincide with the remake released that year. In 2013, MGM licensed the title to Shout! Factory to release a DVD and Blu-ray combo pack with a new HD transfer and newly produced bonus materials. StudioCanal, worldwide rights holder to all of the Embassy Pictures library, has also released several R2 DVD editions using a transfer slightly different from the North American DVD and Blu-Ray releases. In 2018, StudioCanal gave the film its European Blu-Ray debut in the UK, Germany, and Australia. The StudioCanal releases included most extras from the Shout! Factory release as well as a new 4K restoration for a 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition.

I found it sickly sweet and couldn't cope watching it in one hit. It's the typical oops we have switched bodies but something has to change in the family dynamics before we can be switched back scenario. I can't say that we need 'another' one of these films. If they were hoping it would be some holiday classic, I think they might have somewhat missed the mark.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the film, I just didn't love it either.Ed Helms was good in it, and so was Jennifer Garner and even the actors playing their kids. But it just felt like it was missing something, or maybe I am too old and jaded for this kind of film anymore.helpful•4416destiny_westDec 2, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ14How long is Family Switch?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateNovember 30, 2023 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial siteNetflix SiteLanguageEnglishAlso known asGia Đình Đại LoạnFilming locationsLos Angeles, California, USAProduction companiesGrey Matter ProductionsImagine EntertainmentLinden EntertainmentSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 46 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to Family Switch (2023) in Australia?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

She has her hair cropped for the same reason; in medieval London and many other places, prostitutes had their hair cut short as a public humiliation and punishment.GoofsThe woods that Sir Gawain goes through are clearly modern plantations of Sitka spruce (a tree that did not reach Britain until the 19th century), all planted at equal distances apart and all grown to the same size; they look nothing like the old-growth deciduous forests that would have been in medieval Britain.Quotes[last lines] Green Knight: Well done, my brave knight. Now... off with your head.Crazy creditsThere is a short scene at the very end of the credits.ConnectionsFeatured in The 93rd Oscars (2021)User reviews1.9KReviewReviewFeatured review5/10 Not easy to rateDespite one of the biggest divides in critical reception (critical acclaim) and audience reactions (much more polarising, with a large amount of strong dislike) of any film seen by me, 'The Green Knight' was still seen anyway on high recommendation from my sister. Also like Dev Patel, with him coming on a long way as an actor, and have liked David Lowery's other work. Especially 'The Old Man and the Gun'. The subject did fascinate me a good deal and have no problem with symbolism or slow pacing, have even in the past defended films with heavy symbolism and/or slow pacing.Somehow though, 'The Green Knight' was one of those difficult to rate and review films. Really wanted to like it, with how much it had going for it and how highly recommended it was, but it was wildly uneven. There are good things, and those good things are actually quite outstanding. There are also bad things, and a few of the bad things are worse than bad. Actually saw 'The Green Knight' last year, but it has taken a while for me to think over and adequately sum up what my thoughts were.'The Green Knight' does have good things. Cannot fault the acting, with Patel giving perhaps his best performance to date in full command of a strongly written role. Alicia Vikander is suitably enigmatic and 'The Borgias' Sean Harris makes the most of his short screen time. Did think that it started off great, very thought provoking and with a very haunting, creepy mood. The Green Knight is pretty frightening.Also cannot fault the production values, which are quite wonderful. Very handsome and atmospheric scenery enhanced by the vibrant yet also moody photography. The effects work shows a lot of professionalism and care. The music has a haunting ominous vibe and had no problem with how it was placed, also felt that it suited the tone of the story and didn't come over as too heavy.On the other hand, the story felt dully paced and over-extended, starting off with great promise but meanders about a lot in the second half. If you read any synopsis that indicates that a lot goes on, it didn't feel like it to me with a lot of scenes going on for too long, everything that happens post the battlefield sequence (which was well done) to the arrival at the Green Chapel feels like forever. Lowery directs with ambition but sometimes it was very more style than substance and show offy.Furthermore, the symbolism is very heavy handed and not easy to get the head round. Especially in the final act. Some interesting themes here, not dug into deeply or insightfully enough. The whole ending also felt confusing and it feels rather abrupt as well. Too much of the script is too rambling and there is not much fresh or insightful about it.In conclusion, very difficult to rate and review. 5/10.helpful•6911TheLittleSongbirdFeb 12, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ19How long is The Green Knight?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateAugust 5, 2021 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesCanadaIrelandOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial InstagramLanguagesLatinEnglishAlso known asÞE GRENE KNYȝTFilming locationsCahir Castle, Cahir, County Tipperary, Ireland(Anton)Production companiesSailor BearBRON StudiosA24See more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$15,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$17,173,321Opening weekend US & Canada$6,790,917Aug 1, 2021Gross worldwide$18,887,953See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 10 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDolby AtmosAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

It is the most inspired film I have ever encountered.The creators of Toy Story 3 have an imagination that is unparalleled. I cannot begin to compare any of the other animated movies that I have ever seen to it. It is a fantasy in an unconventional sense: aside from the talking toys, the environment and settings are typical; commonplace. Yet, the Pixar Team manages to cram every last drop of energy into the incredibly clever story and inventive plot devices out of just common household objects. The animation is so brilliant that it captures shading, lighting, and textures that have yet to be seen on film.Then, Toy Story 3 becomes a beautiful elaboration on the first two, with very clever character development. Its maturity of relationships is concise but witty: Woody, the wise sheriff, leading the other toys with courage and finesse; a spaceman winning the love of a cowgirl; the loyalty of the dog, slinky; the grumpy married potato and his devoted wife; the superficial relationship of Ken and Barbie; the broken spirit of a lost teddy bear. At the same time, Pixar uses a metaphor that is so strong that it drives the audience to love these characters with all of their hearts. It is a similar emotional complex to a happy puppy who is brought into a home and has nothing on its mind but playing with its youthful owners. But these toys never age, and as its owners, once in their playful youths, leave for work and college, these toys still know nothing more than their youth and happiness of living to one day play again. As you leave for work every morning, your dog doesn't know where you go. And every day, he does nothing more than pray that you come back to see him, every day waiting for you to bring out the ball again for a game of fetch.Finally comes Pixar's ability to integrate so many emotions - fear, love, action, and comedy, among others - with each having so much vigor in its own right, that the movie becomes a roller coaster of animation and adventure, wound together by the constant movement of setting and storyline, always keeping the audience guessing on what might happen next. It is a brilliant tale; a perfect movie for children and adults alike. I cannot wait to see it again.helpful•14932russb216Jul 5, 2010Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign in'Barbie' Joins the Billion-Dollar Film Club'Barbie' Joins the Billion-Dollar Film ClubWelcome to the club, Barbie!

Bosworth himself was honored by the whole situation, saying ""Who else can say they got run over by Burt Reynolds?"" Reynolds went through the hit in one take with no injuries, though he had to be helped off the field. The shots used in the movie of him being helped off of the field were not staged.GoofsWhen driving away in the Bentley after backing into the cop car, the rear end is seen in perfect condition.QuotesCaretaker: Who we gonna crush?(prisoners team): The guards!Caretaker: Who we gonna kill?(prisoners team): The guards!Caretaker: Who we gonna kiss?Brucie: [shouting out loud all alone] The guards!Caretaker: [smile] Gotcha.Alternate versionsOn cruise ship and airline versions, the profanity has not only been redubbed, but quite a bit of alternate footage has been inserted to tone the language down. For instance, Caretaker's line ""Tell Ronnie you got knocked the fuck out"" has been changed to ""Well, tell Ronnie he should have warned you about that truck"". Also, when Caretaker is telling the prison ""women"" that ""it's football, not balls-ball"", it has been replaced with ""it's football, not *that* kind of ball"". And when Ms. Tucker tells Brucie that his ""breath smells like eight cans of shark shit"", this has been replaced with ""your breath smells so bad, I don't know whether to get you a toothbrush or some toilet paper"". Cuts have been made to the video sequences between Crewe and the Warden's assistant, and to the one with Brucie and Ms. Tucker. In the final football game, the repeated statement ""I think he just shit himself"" has been changed to ""I think he broke his freakin' neck"".ConnectionsEdited into The Longest Yard: Deleted Scenes (2005)SoundtracksHella Goodby Pharrell Williams, Chad Hugo, Gwen Stefani & Tony KanalPerformed by No DoubtCourtesy of Interscope RecordsUnder license from Universal Music EnterprisesUser reviews365ReviewReviewFeatured review7/10 Take it for a stand alone movie..Don't compare today's comedy version of ""The Longest Yard"" to the old with Burt Reynolds. Today's is good and effective for what it is, a comedy film with a bit of action interlaced. So many classic Hollywood films were so good, that any attempt at a remake is just going to fall flat on its face. The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler is more of today's take on the story if you asked me. It has humor, and is Sandler at his best with Chris Rock playing his role well too. Critics and classic moviegoers beware. Unless you are open-minded, you will never find the hidden treasures of the movie world. It's a football comedy, plain and simple.helpful•11143kennethcoker1982-1Jun 3, 2005Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ5Why was Paul Crewe abusive to his girlfriend in the beginning of the movie?

The casting director eventually snapped and said, ""Oh, for fuck's sake, get Laura Linney then."" Linney then auditioned and got the part.GoofsWhen Jamie revisits Aurelia, a Marseillaise cab can be seen at the airport, yet everyone in the city seems to understand Portuguese. This can be explained, however, by a large Portuguese community in Marseilles, who live in a common area and would be the ones who understood the language.Quotes[neither understands the other's language] Jamie: [in English] It's my favorite time of day, driving you.Aurelia: [in Portuguese] It's the saddest part of my day, leaving you.Crazy creditsThe list of the cast in the opening credits are arranged  alphabetically
according to their first name.Alternate versionsThere are two instances of switched music between the UK and US versions of the film. In the UK version, the montage introducing the office Christmas party is set to ""Too Lost in You"" by Sugababes, while the US version of the film replaces it with ""The Trouble With Love Is"", performed by Kelly Clarkson. Then, during the second half of the end credits after the Clarkson song plays (for the second time in the US version) the UK version concludes with a cover of ""Jump (For My Love)"", performed by Girls Aloud. This song does not appear at all in the US version, which concludes with the Sugababes song that the UK version used at the party. The 2009 US Blu-Ray actually contains the UK cut of the film, while the original US DVD had the US cut.ConnectionsEdited into Dilwale (2015)SoundtracksChristmas Is All AroundWritten by Reg Presley (as Presley)Performed by Bill NighyCourtesy of Universal Pictures MusicUser reviews1.3KReviewReviewFeatured review9/10 Surprisingly EnjoyableI hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture.Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, ""Love is all Around"" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I.Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I've seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You'd think it wouldn't, I know I certainly didn't.
If you're looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I've seen in recent times, however (I'm just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).It's not trying to be the meaning of life, it's not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it's only trying to do one thing, and that's say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn't end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.This film isn't perfect, I'll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It's superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: ""love actually is all around"" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else.And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I've read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It's like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually.helpful•872154milareppaApr 6, 2004Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ22How long is Love Actually?Powered by AlexaWhat relationship does Sarah have with Juliet or Peter that brought her to the wedding?Is there a complete soundtrack listing?List all of the couples and their relations to the other characters.DetailsEditRelease dateNovember 20, 2003 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited KingdomFranceUnited StatesLanguagesEnglishPortugueseFrenchAlso known asLove Actually Is All AroundFilming locationsMarseille, Bouches-du-Rhône, FranceProduction companiesUniversal PicturesStudioCanalWorking Title FilmsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$40,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$60,221,410Opening weekend US & Canada$6,886,080Nov 9, 2003Gross worldwide$249,537,345See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 15 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalSDDSDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of Love Actually (2003) in Canada?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

The Tyrolian Flag on the wall belongs to South Tyrol. Despite the fact that the cars have the correct French license tags, a local construction company's truck (Kiesunion) is seen on the highway. Also the electrical sockets in the bedroom are Italian, not French. The uniforms of the firemen coming out of the castle after the fire are clearly not French. (The helmets used by the firemen are former Wehrmacht helmets repainted in white and are commonly used by fire brigades in Germany, Austria, and South Tyrol but not in France.)QuotesMr. Leezak: You never see the hard days in a photo album, but those are the ones that get you from one happy snap shot to the next.Alternate versionsMost of the profanity was toned down for most television showings of the film.ConnectionsFeatured in Reel Comedy: Just Married (2003)SoundtracksDo Your ThingWritten by Richard Mitchell, Felix Buxton, and Simon RatcliffePerformed by Basement JaxxCourtesy of XL Recordings/Astralwerks RecordsUnder license from EMI Film & TV MusicUser reviews214ReviewReviewFeatured review6/10 Silly, but Funny!If you're willing enough to forgive some lame jokes & some over-the-top physical humor, then 'Just Married' will certainly work for you. All I can is, I laughed & enjoyed myself! Nothing memorable here, but a good laugh is never bad, is it?'Just Married' Synopsis: A young newlywed couple honeymoon in Europe, where obstacles challenge their ability to sustain the marriage.'Just Married' funnily follows a newlywed couple's series of unfortunate events & turns them into a silly, fun watch. Some jokes land well & some don't. And fortunately enough, 'Just Married' never goes out breath, even though its never entirely engaging. Sam Harper's Screenplay has some LOL moments, that deserve to be credited. Shawn Levy's Direction is satisfactory. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Performance-Wise: The Late/Great Brittany Murphy & Ashton Kutcher willingly own up-to the film's silly humor & deliver entertaining acts. Its a joy to watch Murphy loosen up here, while Kutcher proves yet again that Comedy was always his forte.

The singing and dance sequences were most enjoyable.

However, slightly earlier in his directorial filmography sits this genuine horror-mystery masterpiece, criminally underrated and judged undeservedly.The Village is a different take on a horror trope, detailing an isolated community's resolve against a hidden threat in the surrounding forest. As this genre goes, the cast does not get any better: Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody and Brendan Gleeson all feature prominently, as well as relative unknowns Jesse Eisenberg and Dallas Bryce Howard in some of their earlier roles. All are individually excellent and well-cast, perfectly depicting the repressed fear of a society without outside influences.The plot of is consistent and of genuine quality, which doesn't often translate in the horror genre; however, do not be dissuaded by the premise of horror - The Village plays more off the resulting drama than cheap jump scares, and slow burns until the revelations in the second half blow the script open. The forest village is the ideal setting for this hidden evil, sparsely populated and somewhat bleak - the integral use of red and yellow elevate the cinematography further, making the environment more distressing.The Village should be a must-watch purely on the merit of the plot: some may not connect with the subtleties of the script and the nuances of the story, but those who take the time to invest will be thoroughly rewarded with a quality film.helpful•11019harrylosborneMay 28, 2019Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ35How long is The Village?Powered by AlexaWhat is 'The Village' about?Is 'The Village' based on a book?Where exactly was the movie filmed?

Haunted Mansion is a 2023 American supernatural  horror comedy film directed by Justin Simien from a screenplay by Katie Dippold. It stars LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Dan Levy, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Rideback, it is the second theatrical film adaptation of Walt Disney's theme park attraction The Haunted Mansion, following the 2003 film of the same name. In the film, Gabbie (Dawson) and Travis (Chase W. Dillon) enlist the aid of a team (Stanfield, Haddish, Wilson, and DeVito) to help exorcise the ghosts around them.
Plans for the reboot adaptation based on the Haunted Mansion began in July 2010, when Guillermo del Toro, who intended to write and produce, stated the project would take place in a heightened reality rather than in a real-world setting. Del Toro was no longer attached as the project's director in July 2013. After years in development hell, Disney officially announced Haunted Mansion in August 2020, with Dippold signed on to write a new screenplay. Simien negotiated to direct the film by April 2021, and was officially confirmed three months later. The primary cast was confirmed from July to October, and additional cast was announced the following year. Principal photography took place from mid-October 2021 to late-February 2022 on a $150 million budget.
Haunted Mansion premiered at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, on July 15, 2023, and was released in the United States on July 28 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $118 million worldwide.


Plot[edit]
During a New Year's party, Ben Matthias, an astrophysicist developing a camera to detect dark matter, meets Alyssa, a ghost tour guide, and becomes entranced with her belief in the supernatural. Ben marries Alyssa, but she dies in a car crash, so he gives up his career and continues to run her ghost tour. Ben searches famous haunted places looking for signs of his wife, but he eventually becomes despondent and depressed when he finds no evidence of ghosts.
Years later, widowed doctor Gabbie and her son Travis move from New York into Gracey Manor to turn it into a bed and breakfast, only to learn that it is haunted by a variety of ghosts.
Ben is visited by priest and exorcist Father Kent, who hires him to photograph the ghosts of Gracey Manor. Ben is initially incredulous until he returns home and is haunted by a ghost Mariner who forces him to return to the mansion. Ben learns that Gabbie, Travis, and Kent have also fallen victim to hauntings, forcing them to return to the mansion.
Ben and Kent recruit Harriet, a psychic with legitimate powers, and steal blueprints to the mansion from haunted house historian Prof. Bruce Davis. The group finds a hidden séance room. Harriet manages to contact the spirit of William Gracey, who writes a message instructing them to talk to the legendary medium Madame Leota. However, before they can continue, a mysterious entity forces Harriet out of the house. Bruce arrives shortly afterwards and becomes haunted as well.
The group stays at the mansion where they proceed to look for Leota. Ben goes into the attic where he runs afoul with the ghostly bride Constance Hatchaway and finds a locked trunk. Upon examining the contents, they find a crystal ball which houses the spirit of Leota.
Leota reveals that William Gracey bought the mansion and recruited her to try and contact the spirit of his dead wife Eleanor every night for a full year, however summoned 999 ghosts into the mansion. An evil entity then tricked Gracey into taking his own life and trapped Leota inside her crystal ball. Harriet attempts to perform an astral projection for more answers but ends up sending Ben out of his body. He discovers Gracey, including the evil entity known as the Hatbox Ghost.
The next morning, Bruce takes Ben to get a sketch artist to draw up the Hatbox Ghost, identifying him as Alistair Crump, a rich heir who was abused by his father after his mother's death and eventually expelled from his family manor. Upon reaching adulthood after his father's mysterious death, he inherited his manor back and threw lavish parties so he could kill his fellow socialites out of revenge for being shunned by society, before being beheaded himself by his mutinous servants. The ghost of Crump proceeds to lock the mansion down, but Ben, Kent, and Travis manage to escape. They find Crump Manor, which has become a historical site, and learn from the Mariner (who followed them) that Crump needs someone to willingly give up their life and become the mansion's one-thousandth spirit in order to escape it. Travis finds Crump's hat, which they can use as part of a ritual to banish Crump back to the afterlife.
The three make it back to Gracey Manor where Ben and Kent (who reveals he is actually a conman) rescue Gabbie, Harriet, and Bruce, but Crump burns the hat. Ben also learns from Gabbie that Travis's father is dead, and Crump plans to use Travis's grief to make him the willing and final ghost. Ben finds Travis and manages to convince him to let go of his father as they and Gabbie confront Crump in the graveyard. Kent rallies the ghosts to turn on Crump and join forces with them, and Bruce delivers a piece of the hat to Harriet who uses Leota's incantation to banish Crump. Crump attempts to get Ben to give up his life willingly to see Alyssa again, but Ben reveals he has made peace with losing Alyssa before completing the ritual by kicking Crump in the face, sending him back to the underworld.
Many of the ghosts decide to stay at the mansion, now in harmony with Gabbie and Travis. Ben goes back to teaching and, upon leaving his apartment, pets the cat who has been hanging out by his door, discovering its name is Tater Tot, a nod to his wife's love for the snack. The group reunites on Halloween for a party at the mansion with the happy haunts. Harriet regains full confidence in her psychic abilities, Kent becomes a real pastor, Travis is voted to the student council, Gabbie becomes the newest member of New Orleans General and Bruce maintains his newfound friendships.

Production[edit]
Development[edit]
In July 2010, it was announced that a reboot adaptation based on The Haunted Mansion was in development for Walt Disney Pictures, with Guillermo del Toro as writer and producer.[9][10] Del Toro stated the project would not take place in a real-world setting, but in a heightened reality. He revealed that the Hatbox Ghost would be one of the main characters and said the film would be ""scary and fun at the same time, but the scary will be scary.""[11][12] In June 2011, Walt Disney World Imagineer Jason Surrell was brought onto the project as a creative consultant.[13] In August 2012, Del Toro submitted the final draft of his script to Walt Disney Studios, intended for a PG-13 rating.[14][15] By July 2013, Del Toro announced he was no longer the project's director, but remained as co-writer and executive producer.[16] In April 2015, Ryan Gosling was in early negotiations to star, while D.V. DeVincentis was hired to rewrite the script.[17][18] In September 2016, Brigham Taylor was hired as producer.[19]

Director Justin Simien at the 2023 San Diego Comic-Con
In August 2020, it was announced that Katie Dippold signed on to write a new screenplay for the film, after it was decided that Del Toro's script was too scary for family audiences. Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich were hired as producers. The project will be a joint-venture production between Walt Disney Pictures and Rideback.[20][21] By April 2021, Justin Simien entered early-negotiations to direct the film,[22] and was officially confirmed as director by July 2021.
Bryan Cogman, Del Toro, DeVincentis, Micah Fitzerman-Blue, Noah Harpster, Justin Haythe, Jeff Nathanson, Matthew Robbins, Simien, Steven Thompson, and Chris Weitz wrote additional literary material for the film.[23]
In a behind-the-features featurette, production designer Darren Gilford revealed that the crew had an after-hours tour on the actual Haunted Mansion ride at Walt Disney World. The crew then pulled details from the ride to the sets.[24]

Casting[edit]
Tiffany Haddish, LaKeith Stanfield, Owen Wilson, Rosario Dawson, and Danny DeVito were each cast to appear in the film.[25][26][27][28] In July 2022, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto were revealed to have been cast.[29][30] During the 2022 D23 Expo presentation, it was revealed that Winona Ryder, Dan Levy, and Hasan Minhaj were cast.[31]

Filming and post-production[edit]

Release[edit]
Theatrical release[edit]
Pedicab promoting Haunted Mansion in San Diego, California
Haunted Mansion had its world premiere at Disneyland in Anaheim, California on July 15, 2023. Due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, the film's cast members could not attend the premiere. Instead, the park's Disney characters including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Disney villains such as Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and the Evil Queen walked the red carpet.[38][39] It was released theatrically in the United States on July 28[40] in 4DX[41] and Dolby Cinema formats.[42] It was previously scheduled for March 10, 2023[43] and then August 11, 2023.[44]

Marketing[edit]
Before the film's release, 
the cast appeared on the game show Celebrity Family Feud.[45]

Home media[edit]
Haunted Mansion was released on digital platforms on October 3, Disney+ on October 4, and Blu-ray and DVD on October 17.[46][47]

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]
Haunted Mansion grossed $67.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $49.8 million in other territories, for worldwide gross of $117.5 million.[3][4]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Talk to Me, and was projected to gross $25–30 million from 3,740 theaters in its opening weekend, though a debut of $20–25 million had also been considered possible.[48][49] It made $10 million on its first day, including $3.1 million from Thursday night previews.[2][50] It went on to debut to $24.1 million, finishing in third below Barbie and Oppenheimer, and failing to top the opening weekend of the 2003 film ($24.3 million, unadjusted for inflation). Given its $150 million production budget, Variety opined the opening was ""not a great result for a kid-centric tentpole"", and that the film was ""Halloween-esque"".[51] The film fell 62% in its second weekend to $9.2 million, finishing fifth.[52]

Critical response[edit]
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 37% of 252 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: ""Haunted Mansion's talented cast makes the movie a pleasant enough destination, although it's neither scary nor funny enough to wholeheartedly recommend.""[53] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating ""mixed or average"" reviews.[54] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 80% overall positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[2]
Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, and stated, ""Lakeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Owen Wilson and Jamie Lee Curtis cannot save this laborious story of a creepy old dwelling and the awful Hatbox Ghost"".[55] Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, ""While the visual effects are surprisingly weak for a film of this scale, the script proves far better than anyone might expect, establishing an emotional foundation for what might otherwise be a gimmick-driven haunted house movie.""[56] Lucas Trevor of The Washington Post wrote, ""It’s too dark for a family film, too weightless and juvenile for grown-ups. In a season notable for high-level action spectacle and important auteur projects, Haunted Mansion is not just confused but inconsequential.""[57]

As a New Jersean, I can honestly say Hitch did for New York what Pretty Woman did for Rodeo Drive. The city is appealing, the premise is intriguing and the acting quite wonderful. Only lovelorn prudes that have no hope of a great sex life could hate this movie.Now I'm not saying the movie is perfect as a matter of fact the last act seemed a bit little rushed. Alex's epiphany about love and his feelings for Sara seems incomplete. Is it me or did the director leave some film pieces on the editing room floor? But even with that said, it's a romantic movie that will have men alert enough to have an intelligent conversation afterward. Don't believe what the sour critics say about this movie  besides are any of them single in the current dating world? I believe most of them are either married or so hopelessly ridged in their solitary life that they wouldn't recognize dating for middle classed professionals people if it was on a screen in front of them.Will Smith enters a wonderful genre as Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens, a professional dating consultant, and he is properly showcased with great cast mates - Eva Mendes (Sara), Kevin James (Albert), and Amber Valletta (Allegra). If Smith continues to stretch his talents in this arena I'm sure we'll see a great Tom Hanks, Sleepless in Seattle performance in the future.Hitch is a movie that makes single people and new couples alike believe in finding love in this cynical world. It's worth the price of admission.helpful•14070An_NJ_AngelFeb 11, 2005Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ21How long is Hitch?Powered by AlexaI heard that the screenplay for ""Hitch"" was inspired or, in part, based on a book about dating.

The Secret Life of Pets is a 2016 American animated comedy film produced by Illumination Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures. It was directed by Chris Renaud, co-directed by Yarrow Cheney, and produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, from a screenplay written by Brian Lynch and the writing team of Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio.[6][1] The film stars the voices of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Jenny Slate, Kevin Hart, Ellie Kemper, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey, Hannibal Buress, Bobby Moynihan, Steve Coogan, and Albert Brooks.
The Secret Life of Pets premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival on June 16, 2016, and was released in theaters in the United States on July 8. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed $885.3 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2016 as well as the year's most profitable release.
A sequel, The Secret Life of Pets 2, was released on June 7, 2019, with Patton Oswalt taking over the role of Max from Louis C.K.


Plot[edit]
A Jack Russell Terrier named Max lives with his owner Katie in a New York City apartment. While she is away, he socializes with other pets in the building: tabby cat Chloe, pug Mel, dachshund Buddy, and budgerigar Sweet Pea. One day, Katie adopts the mongrel Duke, making Max envious. Enraged by Max's attitude, Duke tries to abandon Max in an alley, but they are both attacked by cats led by Sphynx cat Ozone who removes their collars and leaves them to be caught by Animal Control. Duke fears that he will be killed if he goes back to the pound. When Gidget, a white Pomeranian who is in love with Max, discovers that he is missing, she decides to find him.
Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball, the leader of ""the Flushed Pets"", a gang of drain-dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners abandoned them. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans by saying they killed their owners, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty through a viper bite, Snowball learns that Max and Duke are domesticated. With their cover blown, Max and Duke escape the drains and board a ferry to Brooklyn, inadvertently killing the viper in the process. Snowball vows revenge and leads the Flushed Pets after them.
Meanwhile, Gidget recruits a red-tailed hawk named Tiberius to find Max, but he mistakenly locates Ozone, whom Gidget coerces into telling what he knows about the dogs. They then enlist Mel, Buddy, Chloe, guinea pig Norman and Sweet Pea. On the way, they meet Pops, an old Basset Hound who helps Gidget and the pets find Max. Gidget and her team later encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of Gidget's team flees.
In the meantime, Duke tells Max about his previous owner Fred, who adopted him as a puppy and loved spending time with him. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was caught by Animal Control, but Fred never came to claim him. They visit Fred's house nearby, confident he will still love Duke and take him back, but they learn from the resident cat Reginald that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who have just returned to the house and called Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes long enough for Max to escape and ends up being captured instead.
While trying to rescue Duke, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball has to work together with Max to save them. They drive a bus into the Animal Control van on the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. The Flushed Pets encircle Max intending to harm him, unaware of Max's new partnership with Snowball, but they are saved by Gidget and her team. The van plummets into the East River as Max tries to free Duke, Snowball decides to jump into the river to give them the keys to Duke's cage and escape the van.
The entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven taxi. Snowball and the Flushed Pets form a new plan to annihilate all humans, but a girl named Molly arrives and adopts Snowball, and the remaining Flushed Pets head back to the drain. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become re-domesticated. The other pets return to their homes and embrace their owners, while Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie.

Production[edit]
Renaud first became involved with the project in 2012, while he was still working on Despicable Me 2.[11] At that time, Illumination's CEO Chris Meledandri pitched him an idea on a film about what pets do when their caretakers are away.[11] Although Renaud found the premise interesting, he and his team did not know what form the story would take, with them at one point considering making it a murder mystery, before deciding to make something ""that was a bit more relatable"".[12] Additional characters were created by author Simon Rich while main character design and production design is provided by Eric Guillon.
The team used Jean-Jacques Sempé as an influence in designing the environment and attention was specifically paid to keep the designs ""very vertically oriented"".[11] In keeping with the tradition of old WB cartoons, the owners' faces are only occasionally seen.[11] The home of the Flushed Pets was created to ""hint at the darker side"" of pet ownership ""without, hopefully, getting too heavy"",[11] as well as to explore ""this whole mythology in New York of the world that's unseen"", while still maintaining the pet theme.[11] The animation was created entirely in France by Illumination Mac Guff.[13]

Music[edit]
Main article: The Secret Life of Pets (soundtrack)
The original score for the film was composed by Alexandre Desplat.[14] The soundtrack was released on July 1, 2016, by Back Lot Music.[15]

Release[edit]
Theatrical[edit]
The film was originally scheduled to be released on February 12, 2016, but was pushed back to July 8.[1] It was released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D using DMR.[16][better source needed] The Secret Life of Pets premiered at the 2016 Annecy International Animated Film Festival on June 16 and was screened at VidCon.[17] A Despicable Me short film, entitled Mower Minions, was attached to the film's theatrical release.[18]

Home media[edit]
The Secret Life of Pets was released on Digital HD on November 22, 2016, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Ultra HD Blu-ray, and DVD on December 6. In addition to the short film Mower Minions which was released theatrically with the feature film, the releases also include two short films: Norman Television and Weenie.[19] The film was the sixth best-selling title of 2016 by making a revenue of $69.7 million from home media sales with 3.6 million units sold.[20]

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]
The Secret Life of Pets grossed $368.3 million in Canada and the U.S. and $516.9 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $885.3 million against a production budget of $75 million.[4][21] Its international takings helped push Universal Pictures [International] past $1 billion for the tenth consecutive year[22] and aided Illumination Entertainment to pass the $4 billion mark for the first time since 2010.[23]
It is the fifth-highest-grossing original worldwide film of all time (behind Avatar, Zootopia, The Lion King, and Finding Nemo),[24] the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2016,[25] and the 18th-highest-grossing animated film of all time. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $374.6 million when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the most profitable release of 2016.[26]

North America[edit]
In Canada and the United States, the film was projected to gross around $70 million in its opening weekend with some predictions going as high as $100 million.[27][28][29] It received the widest release for an animated film as well as for a PG-rated film (breaking Shrek Forever After's record) and the seventh-widest of all time overall across 4,370 theaters, the widest release since The Dark Knight Rises.[28][30][31][32] It made $5.3 million from Thursday night previews in 3,009 theaters which is the second-biggest of all time for Illumination behind only Minions ($6.2 million), and the third biggest of all time for an animated film behind Finding Dory ($9.2 million) and Minions.[29][33] This was followed by a record-breaking $38.5 million opening day gross (including previews), the biggest for an original film.[34][35] In its opening weekend, it exceeded expectations and grossed $104.4 million, finishing first at the box office.[36] Its debut is the sixth-biggest for an animated film, the sixth highest weekend debut in July, and the fourth-biggest opening weekend for Universal Pictures.[37] It also set the record for the largest opening for an original animated film, eclipsing the $90.4 million debut of Inside Out.[38][39]
In its second weekend, the film made $50.8 million (-51.3%) while maintaining the top spot, despite facing stiff competition with newcomer Ghostbusters.[40] Although it slipped into second place when overtaken by Star Trek Beyond in its third weekend, it was still able to fend off the two other new releases—Lights Out and Ice Age: Collision Course—by earning another $29.6 million.[41] It passed $300 million on its twenty-sixth day—the same day it crossed $400 million worldwide[42]—becoming the seventh film of 2016,[43] the seventh Universal Pictures film (the first for the year),[44] and the twelfth animated film overall to reach the benchmark.[45]

Outside North America[edit]
Internationally, The Secret Life of Pets received a scattered release from June to September in a total of 69 markets, and faced competition from other animated films such as Finding Dory and Ice Age: Collision Course in the course of its release.[46][47][48] In total, it had number-one openings in 45 markets and recorded the biggest opening for an original animated film in 17 territories, and the No. 1 animated film of 2016 to date in 13 markets.[23][49] It topped the international box office in its ninth weekend after earning $43.8 million in 53 markets (dethroning Suicide Squad).[50] However, this was not the film's biggest single weekend gross. Its biggest weekend gross was actually in its seventh weekend when it grossed $69.3 million. It opened at No. 3 behind Suicide Squad ($133.3 million) and the Chinese film Time Raiders ($64.6 million) that weekend.[51]
It was released in the United Kingdom and Norway two weeks ahead of its U.S. release, where it grossed a combined total of $14.1 million in the two markets.[46] Prior to its official debut in the UK and the Republic of Ireland on June 24, the film had two days' worth of previews on June 18 and 19 from which it made £3.63 million ($5.2 million) in two days. This figure was later counted in the film's official opening weekend.[52] It went on to score the fourth-biggest original animation opening weekend ever there, with £9.58 million ($13.4 million) from 592 theaters, trailing behind Inside Out, Monsters, Inc., and Up. Excluding previews, its total three-day opening was $8.1 million.[53][54] This was amidst Brexit and despite facing competition from Independence Day: Resurgence.[46][55] The film held off extremely well in its second and third weekend falling just 20% and 24%, earning £4.47 million ($6.1 million) and £3.62 million ($4.8 million) respectively despite facing some competitions.[56][57] It has topped the box office for three consecutive weekends and has grossed total of $41 million there.[58] In Norway, it took the number one spot as well, with $778,000.[46] It scored the biggest animation opening of 2016 and the second-biggest of all time overall in both Taiwan ($2 million)—behind Madagascar, and Hong Kong ($1.9 million)—behind Inside Out.[47]
In Argentina, the film had a record-breaking number-one debut with $4 million from 195 screens—the biggest opening weekend ever for an animated film and the second-biggest opening ever for any film (behind Furious 7). Similarly, Chile also recorded the second-biggest animated opening ever with $1.7 million (behind Minions). Colombia also opened at No. 1 with a huge $1.5 million.[59] In Mexico, other than opening at No. 1, it posted the biggest original animated opening of all time with $7.6 million, surpassing the studio's own previous record holder Inside Out.[48] Also in Russia, it scored the biggest original animated opening and the second-biggest ever for an animated film behind Minions with $16.3 million, although this included $6.4 million five days' worth of previews.[50] It went on to become the highest-grossing film of the summer that year.[60] In Japan, the film opened on August 11—the date of Japan's first Mountain Day national holiday—with Toho-Towa distributing, and earned $4.6 million on 370,000 admissions for its two-day opening weekend dethroning Shin Godzilla off the top spot. The cumulative total for the four-day holiday (August 11–14) was $9.7 million.[22][61] Similarly, it had number-one debuts in Germany ($7.1 million), France ($5.9 million), Australia ($5.6 million), Italy ($5.1 million), Brazil ($4.4 million), Spain ($4.5 million), Poland ($1.7 million), Singapore ($1.3 million), Belgium ($1.2 million), Denmark ($1.2 million), Indonesia ($1.1 million), the Philippines ($1 million), and South Africa ($463,000). In Germany, it scored the best animation opening since Minions.[48][62][63][64][65][66][67][68] It topped the box office in Israel for five straight weekends and in Australia, Russia and Spain for three weekends.[48][50][64][66] In Japan, the film was the highest-grossing foreign release of the weekend, holding the top spot for four consecutive weekends.[63]
In China—the world's second-biggest film market—the film opened on a Tuesday, earning a modest $5.2 million on its opening day. To Sunday, it achieved a six-day opening of $29.3 million and $15.5 million for the weekend alone (Friday to Sunday), with per screen averages over $500 per screen per day. In both instances, it was behind the local film Time Raiders.[62][69][70] In South Korea, despite debuting in fifth place, it had an opening of $6.9 million.[62] Elsewhere, it grossed $2.7 million in the Netherlands, $1.2 million in Sweden and in Hungary, it scored the biggest opening of the year with $738,000,[62] and also in Portugal ($965,000), Latvia ($224,000),[50] and South Africa.[67]
In terms of total earnings, its biggest markets are China ($58 million), United Kingdom and Ireland ($47.2 million), Japan ($41.6 million) and Russia ($34.2 million).[22][50][71] It became the third-highest-grossing film of all time in Russia (behind Avatar and Zootopia)[64] and the highest-grossing film of 2016 in Spain.[23][65]

Critical response[edit]
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 242 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: ""Fast-paced, funny, and blessed with a talented voice cast, The Secret Life of Pets offers a beautifully animated, cheerfully undemanding family-friendly diversion.""[72] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 61 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[73] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 85% overall positive score and a 93% ""definite recommend"".[74]
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars and called it ""an animated fluffball—a sort of Toy Story with pets does everything to drive you crazy and ends up being totally irresistible.""[75] Scott Tobias, writing for NPR, characterized the film's concept as ""Toy Story but with house pets,"" highlighting the film's ""thinly distinguished characters"" and ""gloppy sentimentality"".[76] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three out of four stars and said ""In much the same way that the smash Zootopia demonstrated that creatures of different culture and class and species are better off when they come together, The Secret Life of Pets is a testament to teamwork and friendship and fixing the rifts that divide us. Let the fur—and the warm, fuzzy feelings—fly.""[77]
Some critics disliked the film's similarities to Disney/Pixar's Toy Story.[78] Matthew Parkinson of The Escapist compared the plots of both films and wrote that ""The Secret Life of Pets feels like one of those hour-long ripoffs you'd see on a children's television network.""[79] Ethan Anderton of the website /Film criticized the film's characterization, and noted that the relationship between Max and Duke was akin to ""Woody and Buzz Lightyear all over again.""[80]

This is repeated verbatim from the book, in which, following all the visits, Scrooge calls them ""clever spirits"" for doing it all in one night.Quotes[from trailer] Ebenezer Scrooge: What do you want with me?Jacob Marley: You will be haunted by three spirits.Ebenezer Scrooge: I'd rather not.ConnectionsFeatured in The Jay Leno Show: Episode #1.30 (2009)SoundtracksGod Bless Us EveryoneWritten and Produced by Glen Ballard and Alan SilvestriPerformed by Andrea BocelliCourtesy of Sugar s.r.l.User reviews418ReviewReviewFeatured review8/10 Do some basic research parentsI read that this film has been labeled by parents as a ""Disney Bomb"" because it's too scary for their young children. Parents who take kids to see any movie need to be aware of something: if it's rated PG there are likely going to be scenes that your six year old will not enjoy -- even if the name Disney is attached to it. The cutesy versions of A Christmas Carol (The Muppet Christmas Carol and Disney's own Mickey's Christmas Carol for example) have little in common with the classic, and sometimes very scary Charles Dickens story. The plot should be familiar to just about anyone who has been alive sometime during the past 150 years, and the fact that there are spirits (ghosts) in the story should also be a red flag to parents. Especially since two of them are downright frightening in just about any version of the story.The truth is that this is one of the most beautiful and faithful remakes of the Dickens classic. The dialogue is taken nearly word-for-word from the book, and the look and feel of the film brilliantly capture what you would imagine wintertime in London in the 19th century to be like. A few of the special effects are a bit over-the-top, but most work well and add enough pizazz for cynical modern-day audiences. The scenes featuring the Ghost of Christmas Present are worth the price of admission alone.Once every few months I'm dragged kicking and screaming to see a new film. I can't stand wasting my hard-earned dollar on the crap Hollywood throws at us these days, but every once in a while I'm pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoy a movie. This was definitely one of those rare times.helpful•33846kevcomNov 12, 2009Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inHoliday Movie Posters We LoveHoliday Movie Posters We LoveWe've rounded up some of our favorite posters for holiday movies over the years.

When Hayao Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis, as she was hospitalized in a sanatorium (a specialized hospital for tuberculosis patients and usually located in the countryside), which caused the whole family to move to the countryside. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls.GoofsWhen Mei is walking around with corn, a goat walks up and bears its large teeth.
The goat shows a full set of upper and lower teeth. This is a mistake as goats do not have upper teeth.QuotesTatsuo Kusakabe: Trees and people used to be good friends. I saw that tree and decided to buy the house. Hope Mom likes it too. Okay, let's pay our respects then get home for lunch.Crazy creditsDrawings in the closing credits show the mother returning home in a taxi  and having a bath with Satsuki and Mei. There is also the appearance of a baby dressed in blue, perhaps a younger sibling (brother?) for the girls.Alternate versionsThe humorous line spoken at the start of the film, ""Come out! Come out! Or we'll pull your eyeballs out!"" was deemed 'politically incorrect' by Fox during the making of the English dub. The line is changed to ""Come out! Come out!"" in the Fox-Streamline English dub.ConnectionsEdited into Miyazaki Dreams of Flying (2017)SoundtracksTonari no Totoro(""My Neighbor Totoro"")Lyrics by Hayao MiyazakiComposed by Joe HisaishiUser reviews589ReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 This is the movie I watch to restore my faith in humanityI first saw ""My Neighbor Totoro"" when I was maybe seven.At the time, I thought that it was really boring(that was still when I liked Disney movies). Years later, when I discovered ""Princess Mononoke"" I learned that MNT was by the same director and watched it again. And I find that I appreciate this film a whole lot more now then I did when I was seven.The animation is absolutely stunning(as with all Miyazaki films)and the story is deceptively simple, told with patient, subtle attention to detail. The best example IMO is the scene where Mei falls asleep on Totoro's stomach.It's fruitless to try and describe it;you have to see it for yourself.In closing, I would just like to say that I can't wait for a decent DVD to arrive so I can view this quiet masterpiece in widescreen in Japanese with subtitles.helpful•16623burgan6203Sep 29, 2004Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inLovable Creatures: Our Favorite Screen PalsLovable Creatures: Our Favorite Screen PalsGrogu, E.T., and more cuddly creatures we love to see on the screen.See the galleryPhotosFAQ20How long is My Neighbor Totoro?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 1, 2020 (Netherlands)Country of originJapanOfficial sitesOfficial Site (Japan)Official Site (United States)LanguageJapaneseAlso known asMi vecino TotoroProduction companiesTokuma Japan CommunicationsStudio GhibliNibarikiSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$3,700,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$2,250,213Opening weekend US & Canada$539,245Sep 30, 2018Gross worldwide$30,691,725See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 26 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby StereoRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of My Neighbor Totoro (1988) in Canada?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

It is illegal to buy or sell fireworks in the state of New York, but when this movie was made, that law was not enforced in Chinatown and it was easy to find vendors there selling fireworks illegally while the police looked the other way.QuotesKate McCallister: [at the Plaza Hotel] What kind of hotel allows a child to check in alone?Desk Clerk: The boy had a very convincing story.Kate McCallister: What kind of idiots do you have working here?Desk Clerk: The finest in New York.Crazy creditsJust as the end credits finish, the Hughes logo is moving and making crashing sounds (much like bowling pins being knocked over by a bowling ball, then ending with the sound of a triangle). This is a reference to the film logo moving as seen in the TV spots and theatrical trailer.Alternate versionsFor the television version, about twenty minutes of this movie was edited in very small sections, because this movie is exactly two hours long. In order to watch the full version on television, the time slot is extended to two and a half hours.ConnectionsEdited into Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993)SoundtracksAll Alone on ChristmasWritten and Produced by Steven Van Zandt (as Steven Van Zandt)Performed by Darlene LoveUser reviews360ReviewReviewFeatured review9/10 My personal favourite of the franchiseThe first Home Alone is very good indeed. The last two are just wannabes and feel like they don't belong. Home Alone 2 is my personal favourite, and I watch it about once a month. The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance. I absolutely adored the soundtrack too, New York looks splendid and the Plaza Hotel was incredible to look at. Brilliant movie! 9/10.

History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie.helpful•17635dhunjiwadiaNov 26, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ23How long is Napoleon?Powered by AlexaWhat is the official runtime?Will there be an extended cut?Will it receive a theatrical release or will it be streaming?DetailsEditRelease dateNovember 23, 2023 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial SiteLanguageEnglishAlso known asĐế Chế NapoleonFilming locationsKalkara, MaltaProduction companiesApple StudiosScott Free ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$200,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$59,455,761Opening weekend US & Canada$20,638,887Nov 26, 2023Gross worldwide$198,655,761See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 38 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosDolby Surround 7.1Dolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to Napoleon (2023) in India?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Ben thinks it's to get to know him but James is really trying to scare him away.Technically speaking the plot is about how Ben interferes while James tries to capture a leader of a crime syndicate Omar while on the ride along. Really the ride along is just excuse for insane situations to occur within that setting.Long term this movie will probably be pretty forgettable. As a comedy it is consistently funny and reminiscent of old school improv riffs with the antagonizing eccentric and the straight man. Kevin Hart gets to be absolutely ridiculous, per the usual as Ben: running his mouth, acting a fool, letting self deprecating jokes happen at his expense. I'm a huge fan of the character Kevin Hart has created – while it is the same in every movie it is enjoyable in every movie. Ice Cube is a good polarity as James to Hart's Ben. His smile muscles might be broken. At times he might even be too serious detracting from the chemistry of the duo.The situations these temporary partners get into are random and feel like filler but are funny comedy routines and I'm glad they are still in the film. In an ideal world the writers would've cleaned up the script for a more believable story. Despite this Ride Along is definitely worth the rental just for Hart's antics.More reviews at our website!helpful•163ArchonCinemaReviewsAug 28, 2014Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ20How long is Ride Along?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateMarch 6, 2014 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial SiteLanguagesEnglishUkrainianAlso known asBộ Đôi Cảnh SátFilming locationsAtlanta, Georgia, USA(Peach street)Production companiesUniversal PicturesRelativity MediaCube VisionSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$25,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$134,938,200Opening weekend US & Canada$41,516,170Jan 19, 2014Gross worldwide$154,468,902See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 39 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDatasatSDDSDolby Surround 7.1Dolby AtmosAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the Japanese language plot outline for Ride Along (2014)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

The Best Arnold Schwarzenegger Comedies, Ranked

Published Dec 27, 2020



""Who is your daddy, and what does he do?""

Arnold Schwarzenegger is extremely funny, both accidentally and on purpose. After spending the first decade or so of his blockbuster film career making gonzo action films about impossibly buff heroes with hilariously improbable names (he frequently plays characters with ordinary names like “John” and “Benjamin” as if anyone who looks or sounds like him would ever be named something like that), Schwarzenegger began appearing in comedies that played with his superhero image, at which point we all discovered that he loves making fun of himself. Throw that onto the pile of truly outstanding facial expressions and wordless noises he makes in every single one of his movies, and it all adds up to a marble statue of muscular joy.



In the interest of the historical record, I have rewatched every Schwarzenegger comedy and ranked them according to level of Austrian chuckles. I didn’t include any cameos, which is why this list doesn’t begin with Around the World in 80 Days, a film holding the dual distinction of being one of the shittiest things both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan have ever done.



 9. Killing Gunther (2017) 
       Image via Lionsgate  

Killing Gunther is like What We Do In The Shadows if it were about a bunch of wacky assassins and also extremely bad. A hitman named Blake (Taran Killam) hires a documentary crew to follow him and his team of fellow contract killers as they attempt to hunt down and kill the legendary assassin known as Gunther (Schwarzenegger). Direct-to-camera faux-documentary comedies are already kind of tired, and Killing Gunther doesn’t do much to take advantage of the format, instead relying on tropes and gags that were established over a decade ago by The Office. Schwarzenegger is having fun as an over-the-top assassin, and Killam’s fellow SNL alumnus Bobby Moynihan absolutely kills it as Blake’s explosive expert Donnie. But the movie feels like a mediocre sketch that was stretched out for way too long, with a premise that has been outdated since the mid-90s. (Remember how many “They’re hitmen, but funny!” movies we got in the wake of Pulp Fiction?) There’s a lot of talented performers here, but very few of the jokes land, and I had wished for the blessed release of a spectacular sniper shot more than once by the time the movie finally ended.


 8. Junior (1994) 
       Image via Universal Pictures  

Schwarzenegger actually made two comedies in 1994 – True Lies, which was released during the summer, and Junior, which plopped into theaters over Thanksgiving. Arnold plays a scientist named Alex Hess who, alongside his colleague Larry (Danny DeVito), is developing a fertility drug designed to prevent miscarriages. After a series of improbable events, they decide to impregnate Alex to demonstrate that their drug works. It’s one of the most strangely forgotten films of the 90s – Arnold Schwarzenegger playing a pregnant man in a movie directed by Ivan Reitman should be a thing that we never stopped talking about, and yet we all abruptly did. That’s probably because the movie isn’t very good, partially because of its completely unbelievable premise (they literally just inject an embryo into Alex’s stomach and simply never explain how the baby is staying alive without a womb or umbilical cord and how it is growing without rupturing every single one of Alex’s internal organs) and partially because the laughs just don’t really come. Most of the comedy is based on the cold, clinical Alex slowly beginning to behave like an overly emotional pregnant woman stereotype, which just isn’t all that funny. Like always, Schwarzenegger is game as hell and he absolutely goes for it, but the writing never does him any justice. Junior’s main strength is Emma Thompson, who is absolutely killing it in every possible definition of that phrase. Watching Junior, you are reminded what an incredibly gifted physical comedian Thompson is – she does more with a quick gesture and facial expression than the entire script ever manages to pull off. Junior was an interesting movie to revisit after having not seen it in almost three decades, but it’s one that I never feel the need to see again.


 7. Jingle All the Way (1996) 
       Image via 20th Century Studios  

Schwarzenegger’s 1996 Christmas comedy Jingle All the Way, about an absent father named Howard scrambling to find his son the hottest toy of the season on Christmas Eve, is a fun but flawed movie. It also wound up being weirdly topical, as it was released the same Christmas as the infamous Tickle Me Elmo craze, which was virtually identical to the frenzy surrounding Turbo Man in the film. (People literally fought and trampled each other to get their hands on Elmo, and scalpers sold the doll for nearly $2,000.) The game of the movie is Schwarzenegger’s rivalry with Myron (Sinbad), another desperate father fighting to get his son a Turbo Man action figure. They trade barbs and slapstick hijinks, and constantly try to sabotage each other using various degrees of treacherous violence. It’s a great premise, with a solid supporting cast including Phil Hartman as Howard’s smarmy neighbor Ted (think a sleazy Ned Flanders), Robert Conrad as a motorcycle cop Howard keeps accidentally offending, and Harvey Korman in a brief cameo playing the President of the United States in an episode of Turbo Man. However, the final act takes an incredibly bizarre turn, abandoning the film’s mostly grounded tone for a climactic superhero battle in which Myron takes Howard’s son hostage and Howard dons an actual working jetpack to defeat him. It’s… unexpected.


 6. Twins (1988) 
       Image via Universal Pictures  

Twins was Schwarzenegger’s first official comedy, and also the first of a multi-film collaboration with Ivan Reitman. It’s also easily the most cheerful film about eugenics ever created. Schwarzenegger plays Julius Benedict, a “perfect” human created on a tropical island in a secret genetic experiment. Unbeknownst to him, he was separated at birth from his twin brother Vincent (Danny DeVito), who grew up in an orphanage in America. Julius leaves the island to find Vincent, and let me tell you, hijinks absolutely ensue. Obviously, the main joke of the movie is the idea that Schwarzenegger and DeVito are in any way related, let alone twin brothers. But the script takes that idea and develops it further by making Julius a big, loveable, naïve kid and Vincent a shrewd, opportunistic conman. It’s like watching a musclebound, enthusiastic Spock hang out with Frank Reynolds from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. DeVito is always great and Twins is no exception, but Schwarzenegger proved that he could be charmingly self-deprecating with this role. Much of the comedy of Twins is derived from subverting Schwarzenegger’s image as a taciturn action hero, and watching him play Julius like an adorably excited puppy is even more entertaining than it sounds. The plot is unnecessarily complicated and takes some bizarre turns in the second half, but the core premise works surprisingly well, and Schwarzenegger and DeVito are having a blast playing off of each other.


 5. Hercules in New York (1970) 
       Image via RAF Industries  

Hercules in New York was Schwarzenegger’s first starring role, and it remains a sturdy monument to accidental comedy. Credited as “Arnold Strong” for the film’s original release, Schwarzenegger’s lines were also re-dubbed by some rando cheeseball you’ve probably heard in a dozen kung fu movies because the filmmakers thought Arnold accent was so thick it made his English unintelligible. They were 100% correct. Watching a barely coherent Schwarzenegger scamper through 1960s New York, pummeling cartoonish mobsters, buff sailors, and a man in a literal bear costume while a soundtrack of playful Greek music relentlessly blazes on in the background is a treat every human being should experience at least once in their lifetime. Also, the fresh-faced leading man is so new to acting he clearly forgets his lines in a few scenes, including one blockbuster moment when he flubs “Such fine foods for few small coins?” and simply restarts the line halfway through. (Every DVD and streaming release I’ve seen include Schwarzenegger's original dialogue track, and there is no point experiencing the film in any other way.) You can also clearly hear cars driving by and honking on Mount Olympus, which was almost certainly filmed somewhere in Central Park. Hercules in New York is a tour de force and I simply will not hear otherwise.


 4. Kindergarten Cop (1990) 
       Image via Universal Pictures  

It is my duty to inform you that Kindergarten Cop rips. It’s a surprisingly dark action comedy starring Schwarzenegger as Detective John Kimble, who is forced to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher to try and catch Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson), a murderous drug dealer trying to track down his ex-wife and son, who are living under an assumed name. At first, Kimble is gruff and irritated by the children, employing blatant and ineffective interrogation tactics to try and determine which of his new students is Crisp’s son. Directed by renowned comedic filmmaker Ivan Reitman, Kindergarten Cop plays out like a bonafide crime thriller generously peppered with some solid-ass jokes. The first half of the film, featuring the perpetually annoyed Kimble struggling to deal with a bunch of chaotic toddlers, is particularly hilarious, including an all-time moment in which Kimble confronts a lunch thief and simply drops the kid in bewildered disgust. It’s also one of the most quotable of Schwarzenegger’s films, with lines like “Who is your daddy, and what does he do?” and “It’s not a tumor!” forever ingrained in the pop culture lexicon.


 3. True Lies (1994) 
       Image via 20th Century Fox  

Schwarzenegger’s 1994 action comedy True Lies reunited him with Terminator director James Cameron, resulting in one of the better films of their respective careers and a classic of the genre. Schwarzenegger plays Harry Tasker, an international super spy who runs espionage missions against some of the most dangerous people in the world. But Harry’s wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) think he’s a nerdy computer salesman and one of the most boring human beings on the entire planet. And wouldn’t you know it, Harry’s two lives gradually collide and comedy ensues. There are some legitimately righteous action sequences, and Schwarzenegger gets some memorable laughs, but the real star is the absolutely incandescent Curtis. She plays Helen with a geeky earnestness that gradually morphs into undeniable badassitude, beginning with a near-farcical B-plot involving a sleazy con man / used car salesman named Simon (Bill Paxton, in one of his most thunderous performances). Not everything in True Lies has aged well, most notably a great deal of the jokes Tom Arnold makes about his ex-wives – Arnold is funny as Harry’s partner Gib, but the running “my ex-wife is a bitch” gag is tired and off-putting in 2020. And the movie trucks with some cringeworthy racial stereotypes in that just about every non-white person in the film is a villain. But despite its flaws, it remains a thoroughly fun and mostly hilarious action film featuring Schwarzenegger in his prime.


 2. Commando (1985) 
       Image via 20th Century Fox  

Listen, Commando isn’t technically a comedy in the sense that you would not find it in the Comedy section at Blockbuster unless I had been in the store a few minutes earlier. However, it is absolutely a comedy in that it is unquestionably one of the most hilarious films Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever made. Schwarzenegger plays formal spec ops badass John Matrix, and I could honestly stop right there. His daughter Alyssa Milano is kidnapped by his former teammate Bennett (Vernon Wells) in an attempt to force Matrix into using his considerable talents to help carry out a coup in the fictional country of Val Verde to install the villainous Arius (Dan Hedaya, inexplicably cast as a vaguely South American coke baron) as the new leader, and woe be to those motherfuckers. Matrix does not entertain their plot for one solitary second and instead proceeds to murder every single person involved as he cuts a righteous path of furious violence all the way to Arius’ palace in Val Verde to rescue his daughter. Commando features some of the cheesiest one-liners of Schwarzenegger’s career second only to The Running Man, a movie I seriously considered also including on this list. (He very matter-of-factly breaks a man’s neck sitting next to him on an airplane, then covers him with a hat and blanket and tells the flight attendant “He’s dead tired.”) Matrix obliterates his enemies with excessive 1980s violence that can only be described with a phrase containing the words “juvenile” and “cartoonish,” and yet neither term is a strong enough descriptor. Commando is one of my favorite comedies and I love it with my entire heart.


 1. Last Action Hero (1993) 
       Image via Columbia Pictures  

Last Action Hero is not only the best Schwarzenegger comedy; it is, quite frankly, one of the best movies Schwarzenegger has ever made. A spoof of action movie tropes of the 80s and 90s co-written by Shane Black (who was largely responsible for creating a number of those tropes), the film is carried by a game-as-hell Schwarzenegger operating at maximum enthusiasm. He fully embraces poking fun at both himself and at the genre that made him a superstar. A young latchkey kid named Danny (Austin O’Brien) gets a magic ticket that allows him to travel inside the world of his favorite action film series Jack Slater, starring Schwarzenegger as the titular loose-cannon police detective. Schwarzenegger plays both Jack and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the fact that he plays this film’s version of his real-life self as kind of a dope is a testament to how absolutely committed he is. And do not even get me started on Charles Dance as Benedict, a Jack Slater movie villain who steals Danny’s ticket and uses it to enter the real world, where he joyously discovers that bad guys can actually win here (and they frequently do). Last Action Hero was a notorious bomb, eviscerated by critics and losing $26 million after suffering the cosmic misfortune of opening a week after Jurassic Park hit theaters. (One review called the film “joyless,” leading me to believe it was written by an alien who does not understand human emotion.) But in the decades since its release, the movie has enjoyed a bit of a cultural reevaluation, and literally every single comedy writer I know freaking loves it. Last Action Hero might not be a perfect film (and I’m really stressing “might” here), but it is absolutely a great one.

He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath's gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he's like a really scary psychopath. He's a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture."" Caine bases this belief on a scene where The Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne's penthouse. He'd never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed, he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines.GoofsIt is said that all of the license plates seen on cars in the film are Illinois plates. In fact, they're not: they are actually plates for the fictional Gotham, although they resemble Illinois plates. The ""Gotham"" plates that were created by film makers were made to look like Illinois plates, just in case some slipped through in background shots during filming in Chicago.QuotesThe Chechen: [During a private sit down meeting with the gangsters] What do you propose?The Joker: It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.[mobsters laugh] Salvatore Maroni: If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?The Joker: If you're good at something, never do it for free.Crazy creditsLarge blue flames dissipate in the center to form the new Batman symbol. The film title does not appear until the the closing credits.Alternate versionsThe Blu-ray version of the movie has several of the big action scenes and high altitude photography scenes in ordinary 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen ratio while the rest of the movie preserves the ""scope"" format (2.39:1). This is because these scenes were filmed in IMAX, whose format is 1.43:1, thus attempting to recreate the effect witnessed in IMAX theaters, as well as preserving as much of these shots as possible.ConnectionsEdited into Buba Shel Medina: Episode #2.1 (2013)SoundtracksBalmoralPerformed by The Pipes and Drums of the Chicago Police DepartmentUser reviews8.6KReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 This town deserves a better class of criminal!This movie is a work of art.

From what I saw on the Pay Per View Trailers, I envisioned basically what it's been made out to be, and that was some sort of childrens' screwy Disney-esque space adventureHarsh enough? Don't worry, I turned out to be 100% wrong-o! In fact, as a loyal Trekkie, I had such a blast watching this movie. The inside jokes and references to unnecessary plot complications that have been duplicated down to the last detail on the real-life NSEA Protector scream Star Trek, but it's been so lovingly parodied that no Trek fan could possibly be offended. A total classic, much much funnier than it's given credit for being. I especially enjoyed the pre-teen fans who had the entire ship schematics on their PC at the age when most people are still playing with Power Rangers figures and Barbies, which is an all-too real phenomenon in the Trek fan community.The acting is top-notch, (Tim Allen plays the scene-stealing hack down to the last detail, Sigourney Weaver is hilarious as the token female on the ship, Alan Rickman adds wonderful conflict as a furious Shakespearian actor who is convinced his role on the show ruined his career) the special effects are just fabulous, and the few poignant moments are done so well that it's damn near tear-jerking.

Finding Nemo is a 2003 American animated comedy-drama adventure film[2] produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Andrew Stanton (in his feature directorial debut) with co-direction by Lee Unkrich, the screenplay was written by Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds from a story by Stanton. The film stars the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, and Geoffrey Rush. It tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin (Brooks) who, along with a forgetful regal blue tang named Dory (DeGeneres), searches for his missing son Nemo (Gould). Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.

Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. The inspiration for Finding Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. Thomas Newman composed the score for the film.

Premiering in Los Angeles on May 18, Finding Nemo was released in theaters in the United States on May 30, 2003. Upon its release, it received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the visual elements, screenplay, animation, Newman's score and characters that have been cited as funny to both young moviegoers and their parents.[3] It also became the highest-grossing animated film at the time of its release, and was the second-highest-grossing film of 2003, earning a total of $871 million worldwide by the end of its initial theatrical run.[4] The film received four nominations at the 76th Academy Awards, and won the award for Best Animated Feature, becoming the first Pixar film to do so.

Finding Nemo is the best-selling DVD title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2006,[5] and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar's own Toy Story 3 overtook it. The film was re-released in 3D in 2012. In 2008, the American Film Institute named it as the 10th greatest American animated film as part of their 10 Top 10 lists.[6] A sequel, Finding Dory, was released in June 2016.

Plot
Clownfish Marlin and his wife, Coral, live happily in an anemone in the Great Barrier Reef. They are about to become parents, waiting for their many eggs to hatch. The family is attacked by a hungry barracuda, knocking Marlin out. Upon waking, Marlin finds that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda; the last remaining egg is cracked. Marlin vows to keep his only surviving child safe.

Six years later, Marlin is now overprotective of his son, Nemo, who is starting his first day at school. During an argument over Marlin's overprotectiveness, Nemo defiantly swims to a speedboat and is captured by scuba divers. Marlin pursues the boat in vain and bumps into Dory, a blue tang with acute short-term memory loss, who offers her help. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin finds a diver's mask that fell from the boat, accidentally hitting Dory. The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a frenzy and he accidentally sets off old naval mines that knock Marlin and Dory unconscious.

Nemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney. He meets the ""Tank Gang"" led by Gill, a Moorish idol. The Tank Gang tells Nemo that he will be given to Sherman's niece, Darla, who killed her previous fish. Gill, who wishes to return to the ocean, devises an escape plan: Nemo must squeeze inside the aquarium's filter tube and block it with a pebble, obliging Sherman to put the fish into bags while he cleans the tank. This will allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo tries but fails and is almost killed.

Marlin and Dory wake up but the mask falls into a deep trench. Swimming after it, they are attacked by an anglerfish. Dory memorizes the address on the goggles before they escape. The two take directions for East Australian Current from a school of moonfish but find themselves in a forest of jellyfish. Stung and knocked unconscious, they awaken in the East Australian Current with a large group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. The story of Marlin's quest is relayed by the turtles all across the ocean to Sydney, where it reaches a pelican named Nigel. Nigel tells the Tank Gang, motivating Nemo to try the pebble trick again. He successfully blocks the filter, and soon, the aquarium is covered in green algae.

The sea turtles take Marlin and Dory to their Sydney exit, where they get lost and are consumed by a blue whale. The whale expels them through its blowhole into Sydney Harbour. Nigel takes them to Sherman's office, where Nemo is playing dead to avoid being given to Darla. Marlin sees this just as Sherman throws Nigel out of his office. Gill helps Nemo escape through the sink drain that leads to the ocean.

Believing his son is dead, Marlin sadly says goodbye to Dory and leaves. Nemo meets Dory, who helps him reunite with Marlin. However, a fishing trawler captures her in a net along with a school of groupers. Nemo and Marlin work together, instructing the fish to swim down. Their combined force breaks the net, saving Dory. Upon their return home, Marlin is now more confident and outgoing, accompanied by Dory. The two see Nemo off as he leaves for school. Meanwhile, after the dentist's filter breaks, the Tank Gang escapes into Sydney Harbour in their bags. Now successfully in the ocean but still stuck in the bags, they ponder what to do next.

Production
Development

Andrew Stanton wrote and directed the film.
The inspiration for Finding Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.[8] In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.[9] Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.[8]

In an interview with National Geographic magazine, Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone:

It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn't take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish—it was perfect. There's almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you.[10]

In addition, clownfish are colorful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.[8] Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of A Bug's Life. As a result, Finding Nemo began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director Lee Unkrich called ""very unusual for an animated film"".[8] The artists took scuba diving lessons to study the coral reef.[8]

Stanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie.[8] The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he's from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children's storybook that shares exactly the same details.[8]

Casting
William H. Macy was the first actor cast as Marlin. Although Macy had recorded most of the dialogue, Stanton felt that the character needed a lighter touch.[11] Stanton then cast Albert Brooks in the role, and in his opinion, it ""saved"" the film.[8] Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn't funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.

The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Stanton and Bob Peterson while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast Ellen DeGeneres when he watched an episode of Ellen in which he saw her ""change the subject five times before finishing one sentence"".[8] The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and fastidious and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald's character was minimized.[8]

Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film's story reel and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich's office.[8] Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director Brad Bird. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was ""this generation's Thumper"" and immediately cast Nicholas.[8]

Megan Mullally was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were stunned to learn that the voice of her character Karen Walker on the television show Will & Grace was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.[12]

Animation
To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii, and received in-house lectures from an ichthyologist.[13] As a result, Pixar's animator for Dory, Gini Cruz Santos, integrated ""the fish movement, human movement, and facial expressions to make them look and feel like real characters.""[14][15] Production designer Ralph Eggleston created pastel drawings to give the lighting crew led by Sharon Calahan ideas of how every scene in the film should be lit.[16]

The Great white shark, Bruce, is in reference to the animatronic shark used in the Universal film Jaws. The shark they had used on set was nicknamed ""Bruce"" after Bruce Raiman, who was Steven Spielberg's divorce lawyer.[17] The line ""Here's Brucey!"" is a reference to the Jack Nicholson line from the 1980 horror film, The Shining.[18] Additionally, the music that plays for the dentist's niece Darla is the theme music from the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film, Psycho.[19]

The film was dedicated to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died of melanoma in October 2002.[20] Finding Nemo shares many plot elements with Pierrot the Clownfish,[21] a children's book published in 2002, but allegedly conceived in 1995. The author, Franck Le Calvez, sued Disney for infringement of his intellectual rights and to bar Finding Nemo merchandise in France. The judge ruled against him, citing the color differences between Pierrot and Nemo.[22]

Localization

Patrick Stump performed a Navajo version of the end-credits song Beyond the Sea.
In 2016, Disney Character Voices International's senior vice president Rick Dempsey, in collaboration with the Navajo Nation Museum, created a Navajo dubbing of the movie titled Nemo Há’déést’íí which was released in theaters March 18–24 of the same year.[23][24] The project was thought as a means to preserve Navajo language, teaching the language to kids through a Disney movie.[25] The studio held auditions on the reservation, but finding an age-appropriate native speaker to voice Nemo was hard, Dempsey said, as the majority of native Navajo speakers are over 40 years old.[24] The end credits version of the song ""Beyond the Sea"", covered in the English version by Robbie Williams, was also adapted into Navajo, with Fall Out Boy's lead singer Patrick Stump performing it.[26] Finding Nemo was the second movie to receive a Navajo dubbing: in 2013, a Navajo version of Star Wars was created.[27]

Soundtrack
Main article: Finding Nemo (soundtrack)
Finding Nemo was the first Pixar film not to be scored by Randy Newman. The original soundtrack album was instead scored by Thomas Newman, his cousin, and released on May 20, 2003.[28][29] The score was nominated for the Academy Award for Original Score, losing to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[30]

Release
Marketing
Disney released a teaser trailer of Finding Nemo in September 2002 on the Monsters, Inc. home video releases. The teaser was later released online, and was attached to theatrical screenings of The Santa Clause 2.[31] Trailers for the film were later attached to the home video releases of Treasure Planet,[32] Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World,[33] Inspector Gadget 2 and other Disney films.[34] There were also TV spots that shared ""Fishy Facts"" about sharks, turtles and pelicans. One of these ads, particularly the one about sharks, can be found on the second disc of the Collector's Edition DVD release of A Bug's Life, which was released three days before the film's release on May 27, 2003.[35]

McDonald's restaurants began to sell eight Happy Meal toys based on the film.[36] At the 100th North American International Toy Fair event in New York City, Hasbro unveiled a variety of Finding Nemo toys.[37] A cereal themed to the film was released by Kellogg's, consisting of naturally sweetened oats with fish-shaped marshmallows.[38] Finding Nemo was advertised as promotional partners on other companies, like Frito-Lay, Keebler, Pepsi, Ralphs, Dreyer's, Jel Sert, Airheads, Orville Redenbacher's and THQ. Before May 26, 2003, stickers on over 50 million bags of potato chips alerted consumers to a sweepstakes dangling a trip for four to Sydney, Australia with a visit to the Great Barrier Reef. On May 17, 2003, Frito-Lay hosted an event at each of the Walmart stores, where kids could use 3D goggles to find hidden images of Nemo. Kellogg's packed eight different water toys depicting film characters inside Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Honey Smacks and Cocoa Rice Krispies cereal boxes. The Honey Smacks, Frosted Flakes, Cinnamon Crunch Crispix and Froot Loops boxes also carried a Nemo memory card game on back panels. Plus, a Nemo-themed Marshmallow Froot Loops cereal featured four of the film's characters. Consumers could mail in two UPCs from the three Kellogg's cereals to receive a large beach towel. Besides this, the company unveiled a new type of Pop-Tarts inspired by Finding Nemo. Known as the Great Berry Reef Pop-Tarts, they had a wild berry filling and fish sprinkles. A pool raft was available with two Pop-Tart UPCs and shipping, handled by Draft Worldwide of Chicago. Eggo waffles would offer holographic swimming goggles with the purchase of two of its products with shipping and handling. For their snacks division, Kellogg's offered consumers who purchased two packages of select products and two gallons of milk with a giant inflatable shark. The company advertised the film on Vanilla Wafers, Chips Deluxe, Mini Fudge Shoppe Fudge Stripes, Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies, Rice Krispies Treats and limited edition Nemo-themed cookies.[39]

On May 20, 2003, Kellogg's recalled Frosted Flakes cereal boxes due to their extremely close resemblance of a Hasbro memory card game. A lawsuit was filed against the company, which included a full-page reproduction of the front of a Frosted Flakes box with the cereal's familiar Tony the Tiger mascot grinning next to Nemo, Dory & Crush from the film. Disney had licensed the characters to use on the game cards. Hasbro had filed the suit to protect its trademark against blatant infringement.[40]

Theatrical
Finding Nemo was not only the fifth Pixar film, but was also the first one to be released during the summer instead of November, much like its four predecessors.[41] The film premiered in Los Angeles on May 18, 2003,[42] and opened in theaters with The Italian Job and Wrong Turn on May 30, 2003.[43]

Home media
Finding Nemo was released on VHS and DVD on November 4, 2003, both THX-certified and taken from the digital source.[44][45] The 2-disc DVD release sold more than 8 million copies on the first day of release, taking Spider-Man's record for having the highest single-day DVD sales.[46] It also surpassed Monsters, Inc. for having the highest single-day record for an animated movie.[47] Within two weeks, it went on to become the best-selling DVD of its time, selling over 15 million copies and beating The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.[48] With over 40 million copies sold, Finding Nemo currently holds the record for the best-selling DVD release of all time.[49] The first disc features a widescreen version, documentaries, galleries and an audio/visual commentary, and the second disc features a full-frame version, games, bonus shorts (Knick Knack, which was shown alongside the film in theaters, and Exploring the Reef), and the advertising campaign. Both discs also feature introductions from Stanton and Unkrich and ""virtual aquariums"" based on the film's various settings.[50][51]

The film was then released on both Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray on December 4, 2012, with both a 3-disc and a 5-disc set.[52] In 2019, Finding Nemo was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray.[53][54]

Reception
Box office
Original theatrical run
During its original theatrical run, Finding Nemo grossed $339.7 million in the United States and Canada and $531.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $871.0 million.[4] It was the second-highest-grossing film of 2003, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[55][56] Finding Nemo also defeated The Matrix Reloaded to become the highest-grossing film of the 2003 summer season.[57] The film sold an estimated 56.4 million tickets in the United States during its initial theatrical run.[1]

On its opening weekend, Finding Nemo earned $70.6 million in the United States and Canada.[58] When the film opened, it was ranked number one at the box office, dethroning Bruce Almighty.[59] Additionally, it surpassed its predecessor Monsters, Inc. for having the highest domestic opening weekend for an animated film.[59] It would hold this record until Shrek 2 took it the following year.[60] During its second weekend, the film dropped to second place behind 2 Fast 2 Furious.[61] It declined by 34% while making $45.8 million.[62] Nevertheless, the film returned to the number one spot the following week. At that point, it earned $29.2 million, bringing the total domestic gross to $192.3 million. Finding Nemo was the first film to reclaim the number one spot since Die Another Day and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in 2002.[63] It would also outgross the weaker openings of Rugrats Go Wild, Hollywood Homicide and Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd.[64] By the film's 20th day of release, Finding Nemo had earned over $200 million.[65] During the film's fourth weekend, it was overtaken by Hulk.[66] Despite this, Finding Nemo continued to draw in large crowds and families throughout the summer season while outgrossing another animated film, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas.[67]

By July 2003, Finding Nemo had earned $274.9 million, beating The Matrix Reloaded and becoming the top-grossing movie of the year.[68] The film even surpassed Shrek to become the second highest-grossing animated film.[69] Later that month, the film had earned over $300 million, becoming the highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada, surpassing The Lion King.[70] By the end of the summer season, Finding Nemo was one of five films to reach $200 million at the box office in a single summer season, with the others being X2, The Matrix Reloaded, Bruce Almighty and Disney's own Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.[71] At the end of its theatrical run, Finding Nemo grossed $339.7 million in the United States and Canada and $531.3 million in international territories, totaling $871.0 million worldwide. In all three occasions, it had outgrossed The Lion King to become the highest-grossing animated film. It stayed in the Top 10 until August 14 (11 weeks total).[72] In North America, it was surpassed by both Shrek 2 in 2004 and Toy Story 3 in 2010.[73] Finding Nemo would hold the record for having the highest international gross for an animated film until 2009 when it was taken by Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.[74] Outside North America, it stands as the fifth highest-grossing animated film. Worldwide, it currently ranks as the ninth highest-grossing animated film. Moreover, it was the highest-grossing Disney film for three years before Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest surpassed it.[75] Finding Nemo was also the fourth animated film to make $500 million worldwide, joining Monsters, Inc., Aladdin and The Lion King.[76]

The film had impressive box office runs in many international markets. In Japan, its highest-grossing market after North America, it grossed ¥11.2 billion ($102.4 million), becoming the highest-grossing foreign animated film in local currency (yen).[77] It has only been surpassed by Frozen (¥25.5 billion).[78] Plus, Finding Nemo was the second film by Buena Vista Pictures to reach $100 million in the country, just after Armageddon in 1999.[79] The film also grossed £37.2 million ($67.1 million) in the U.K., Ireland, and Malta.[80] At the Manchester UCI Cinemas, it made a total three-day opening gross of £17,150 ($28,583), becoming the theater's highest-grossing digital film at the time, surpassing Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones and numerous other releases.[81] Making £28.7 million ($35.7 million), Finding Nemo was the highest-grossing film released in October 2003 in the region, beating Bad Boys II.[82] Following in biggest grosses are France and the Maghreb region ($64.8 million), Germany ($53.9 million), and Spain ($29.5 million).[80]

3D re-release
After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King, Disney re-released Finding Nemo in 3D on September 14, 2012,[83] with a conversion cost estimated to be below $5 million.[84] For the opening weekend of its 3D re-release in North America, Finding Nemo grossed $16.7 million, debuting at the No. 2 spot behind Resident Evil: Retribution.[85] The film earned $41.1 million in North America and $28.2 million internationally, for a combined total of $69.3 million, and a cumulative worldwide total of $940.3 million.[1]

Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger described it as ""a genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic.""[105] On the 3D re-release, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that its emotional power was deepened by ""the dimensionality of the oceanic deep"" where ""the spatial mysteries of watery currents and floating worlds are exactly where 3D explorers were born to boldly go"".[106]

Finding Nemo was included on a number of best-of lists. The film appeared on professional rankings from BBC and The Independent based on retrospective appraisal, as one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century.[107][108] Several publications have listed it as one of the best animated films, including: IGN (2010),[109] Insider, USA Today, Elle (all 2018),[110][111][112] Parade, Complex, and Time Out New York (all 2021).[113][114][115] In December 2021, the film's screenplay was listed number 60 on the Writers Guild of America's ""101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)"".[116]

Accolades
Main article: List of Pixar awards and nominations: Finding Nemo
Finding Nemo won the Academy Award and Saturn Award for Best Animated Film.[117] It also won the award for Best Animated Film at the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards, the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards, the National Board of Review Awards, the Online Film Critics Society Awards, and the Toronto Film Critics Association Awards.[118] The film received many other awards, including: Kids Choice Awards for Favorite Movie and Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie (Ellen DeGeneres), and the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress (Ellen DeGeneres).[118]

Environmental concerns and consequences
The film's use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the fish breed as pets in the United States, even though the story portrayed the use of fish as pets negatively and suggested that saltwater aquariums are notably tricky and expensive to maintain.[120] The demand for clownfish was supplied by large-scale harvesting of tropical fish in regions like Vanuatu.[121] The Australian Tourism Commission (ATC) launched several marketing campaigns in China and the United States to improve tourism in Australia, many of them utilizing Finding Nemo clips.[122][123] Queensland used Finding Nemo to draw tourists to promote itself to vacationers.[124] According to National Geographic, ""Ironically, Finding Nemo, a movie about the anguish of a captured clownfish, caused home-aquarium demand for them to triple.""[125]

The reaction to the film by the general public has led to environmental devastation for the clownfish, and has provoked an outcry from several environmental protection agencies, including the Marine Aquarium Council, Australia.[citation needed] The demand for tropical fish skyrocketed after the film's release, causing reef species decimation in Vanuatu and several other reef areas.[126] After seeing the film, some aquarium owners released their pet fish into the ocean, but failed to release them into the correct oceanic habitat, which introduced species that are harmful to the indigenous environment, a practice that is harming reefs worldwide.[127][128]

A 2017 study by researchers from James Cook University in Australia found little evidence for fan-based purchases of wild-caught fish immediately (within 1.5 years of release) following the film.[129]

A spin-off sequel[a] to this film was released in June 2016, titled Finding Dory.[136] It focuses on Dory having a journey to reunite with her parents (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy).[131][137] Like the previous film, Finding Dory was a financial success and fared well with critics.[138][139]

Video games
Main article: Finding Nemo (video game)
A video game based on the film was released in 2003, for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. The goal of the game is to complete different levels under the roles of Nemo, Marlin or Dory. It includes cut scenes from the movie, and each clip is based on a level. It was also the last Pixar game developed by Traveller's Tales. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews.[140][141][142][143][144][145] A Game Boy Advance sequel, titled Finding Nemo: The Continuing Adventures, was released in 2004.[146]

Theme park attractions
Finding Nemo has inspired numerous attractions and properties at Disney Parks around the world, including: Turtle Talk with Crush, which opened in 2004 at Epcot, 2005 in Disney California Adventure Park, 2008 in Hong Kong Disneyland, and 2009 in Tokyo DisneySea; Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, which opened in 2007 in Disneyland Park; The Seas with Nemo & Friends, which opened in 2007 at Epcot; Finding Nemo – The Musical, which opened in 2007 in Disney's Animal Kingdom; and Crush's Coaster, which opened in 2007 at Walt Disney Studios Park.[147][148][149]

It's a 1960s R-rated horror prequel to a lackluster origin film starring Lulu Wilson based on possession & exorcism, ultimately tying in strongly with its predecessor. As I felt Origin of Evil had strong plot development, acting (though Wilson isn't the standout here that she was in O:OoE), cinematography, and overall eeriness, I could say most of the same things for Annabelle: Creation, though I find them all just a notch below.Given the time period that this film takes place, the technology that was present served this film very well in the throwback sense, either because it doesn't make the characters too idiotic to not rely on their technology more often, or it doesn't allow the supernatural to manipulate their technology too much to the point of ridiculousness. Even traditional items like a bell (similar to The Uninvited), a well (similar to The Ring), or a dumbwaiter (many horror films) work because of the particular time period that it's in and add to the atmosphere the film builds up. Several elements like this were heavily in play and made for a fun setting.Here's where I have a mixed bag of positive/negative, and it has to do with the direction. James Wan is clearly a heavy influence for David Sandberg (Lights Out), but part of me feels like Sandberg and crew watched Wan's Conjuring films, created a checklist, and tried their best to check all of those boxes. It makes for great horror, but part of it makes me feel like I've seen it all before. If Wan was directing, I think he would find a new way to shoot certain scenes and present certain items. Given the setting I was referring to before, I saw all of the foreshadowing coming into play a bit too easily. It's like it was all on-the-nose. You also can telegraph all of the jump scares. That doesn't mean they weren't still effective and that the film wasn't still scary on its own (trust me, there are plenty of non-jump-scare moments that are still very good), but I feel like I just saw a Wan copycat instead of Wan himself is all. I mean that's not a bad thing, because I considered Wan as the new master of horror before he decided to become an action director. Just food for thought is all.Now I will give Sandberg some credit. He played with out-of-focus scenery more than Wan had in the past, making us look in the dark areas or the background to see if something was lurking about. I also think he included more shock factor regarding when things can occur (daytime, early stages of the film) and how at-risk all of the children really were, making them all vulnerable to victimization by injury, possession, and/or death. I also think that without a star-studded adult cast it was a lot easier to give the child actors a lot of limelight, to the point that I knew all of them really quickly (in The Conjuring, I couldn't tell you a single one's name as they were more pawns for Wilson and Farmiga). Every so often he would let the camera cut away for the scary thing to appear/disappear/move and such, but then sometimes he would just say ""screw it"" and do it right in the shot just to mess with the audience, who was thoroughly engaged in this film from start to finish.The thing I think most people have to remember about this film, which I sometimes forget myself, is that Annabelle is just a doll... creepy looking, but just a doll nonetheless. She's not like Slappy or Chucky, where the doll is the soul in and of itself. The doll may act as a conduit for the demon however; we have known this since The Conjuring. However, this demon can also do it in its own form, or into a human, or anything else that it wants to... even more than one place at a time. Makes it kind of strange that Annabelle still remains the highlight of the film by the title, but these films are less about the doll and more about the entity, and that's fine with me. I just have to keep reminding myself that.I want to close by saying that these films (Conjuring 1 & 2, Annabelle & prequel, Ouija & prequel) remind me a lot of the Paranormal Activity film franchise: despite a different setting and finding new ways to try and scare the audience, the story largely remains the same. Big family in big house dealing with possession and finding a way to exorcise it. Personally, I dig them all, but they aren't reinventing the wheel, so don't assume this is a fresh new take on the genre. However, given that Annabelle was so poorly received, you had to assume that if they were making this film, they likely said: ""Let's make sure that doesn't happen again, so what can we do differently?"" They found it, and it's called Annabelle: Creation. Very good, though I've kind of seen it before. That's okay though, because it ain't broke. I just don't know how much longer it can last and still bring in myself and other audiences.helpful•5742Brandon_Walker_RobinsonAug 10, 2017Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateAugust 10, 2017 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial SiteOfficial Site (Brazil)LanguagesEnglishSpanishAlso known asAnnabelle 2Filming locationsSimi Valley, California, USA(Mullins' House)Production companiesNew Line CinemaRatPac-Dune EntertainmentAtomic MonsterSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$15,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$102,092,201Opening weekend US & Canada$35,006,404Aug 13, 2017Gross worldwide$306,592,201See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 49 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath's gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he's like a really scary psychopath. He's a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture."" Caine bases this belief on a scene where The Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne's penthouse. He'd never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed, he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines.GoofsIt is said that all of the license plates seen on cars in the film are Illinois plates. In fact, they're not: they are actually plates for the fictional Gotham, although they resemble Illinois plates. The ""Gotham"" plates that were created by film makers were made to look like Illinois plates, just in case some slipped through in background shots during filming in Chicago.QuotesThe Chechen: [During a private sit down meeting with the gangsters] What do you propose?The Joker: It's simple.

This is because these scenes were filmed in IMAX, whose format is 1.43:1, thus attempting to recreate the effect witnessed in IMAX theaters, as well as preserving as much of these shots as possible.ConnectionsEdited into Buba Shel Medina: Episode #2.1 (2013)SoundtracksBalmoralPerformed by The Pipes and Drums of the Chicago Police DepartmentUser reviews8.6KReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 This town deserves a better class of criminal!This movie is a work of art.

And I get that this is not for everyone. But I do believe that a rating that is currently around 7 (out of 10) is pretty accurate for this movie. It is good, it's not amazing or breath taking (excuse the pun), but it really is suspenseful and it does keep it real (if you buy into the whole notion that this space mission/travel thing is or will be possible in the first place of course).We do have some great actors involved in this, but you can imagine that there are moments in the movie where some may feel the movie could offer more. But that would not be keeping it real. Of course there are some decisions that are questionable at best, but that's life and that's how people work sometime ...

Telling the story of Ted Bundy from the perspective of a woman who was oblivious to his true nature is an interesting narrative choice, and had Berlinger stuck to this format, it could have made for a fascinating film. However, the longer it goes on, the more it seems to revel in Bundy's flamboyance, and what begins as an intriguing insider's look at living with a killer soon shifts into an underwhelming courtroom drama, only returning to its original tone in the final (fictional) scene.The film begins in 1969, the night Bundy (Efron) and nm10616856 (Lily Collins) first met in a Seattle bar. As a single mother with a low-paying job, she is surprised to find this charismatic, handsome, and intelligent law student so interested in her, but interested he is, with the duo quickly falling in love. However, six years later, when he is stopped in Utah for a minor traffic violation, the police find ropes, handcuffs, ski mask, leather gloves, and a crowbar in his car, and he is subsequently charged with and convicted of attempted kidnapping. He vehemently protests his innocence to Liz, and although concerned, she accepts his explanations. However, as police departments across California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and Florida start to connect him to a string of recent murders, it becomes harder and harder for Liz to deny there's more to her boyfriend than she ever imagined.Very loosely based on Liz Kloepfer's memoir, The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy (1981), Extremely Wicked was written by Michael Werwie. The hook for the original script was that the audience is unaware the character is Bundy; the film was written as a supposedly fictional story of a young couple whose life is shattered when he is accused of multiple murders, with his real identity only coming as a final act twist. As Berlinger was completing The Ted Bundy Tapes, the script was offered to him, and although he found the twist distasteful, he loved the idea of looking at the Bundy story through the eyes of someone who thought him to be innocent.One of the biggest appeals of the movie, of course, is the unexpected casting of Zac Efron as Bundy (Efron also serves as executive producer). And it has to be said, he's excellent. Although he doesn't really look like Bundy, he has the mannerisms down to a tee. Especially if you watch the film after the docu-series, you'll really pick up on the depth of the performance; Efron's every movement and gesture, the way he smiles, the way he stands, the tone of his voice, everything is perfect. Of course, Bundy's good looks and charisma were his most formidable weapons as he proved that evil could fester under an attractive façade, and this gives Efron room to manoeuvre, playing every scene in such a way that the subtext is always apparent, although never allowing Bundy's mask to slip. Indeed, it's the absence of any obvious monstrousness in the performance which is so unnerving.One of the film's most notable components is that, apart from one brief scene near the end, there is no depiction of violence. As Liz's story, the idea is to present Bundy not with the 20/20 hindsight of history, but with the same degree of ambiguity with which she would have viewed him. It's an interesting way into the story and seems a genuine attempt to do something more than simply reproduce the salacious details of the crimes. Of course, if you're making a film about a serial killer which doesn't feature much in the way of serial killing, you're going to need to fill it with something, and in this sense, Berlinger focuses, at least in the first half, on how a killer can lie and manipulate, coming across as completely normal to all who know him. Berlinger has said that the film is about the mechanics of how a person can be ""seduced by someone capable of evil"", and it was his intention that the audience actually like Bundy, as he wanted them to feel disgust with themselves - just like Liz, he wanted them to be seduced by evil.However, as admirable as this approach is, the film has a lot of problems. For one thing, because it depicts Bundy not as we now know him but as his contemporaries saw him, it means we only see the performative side, never the monstrous underbelly. Sure, this means that the film avoids exploitation, but in doing so, it could be accused of sanitisation (to be fair, this is something of a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario - show the murders and you're exploiting real-life suffering, don't show them and you're hiding the true nature of his crimes). And granted, portraying him as a possibly innocent man is part of the attempt to explain how Liz could be duped, but all the good intentions in the world don't change the fact that the film's Bundy is a lovable rogue who bites his thumb at the system, not a murderer, a man who raped and butchered a 12-year-old child, and who decapitated multiple women and had sex with their corpses.I understand that Berlinger wants to depict how Liz could have been blinded by devotion to a man that she thought (correctly, as it turned out) was too good to be true. But the problem is that she herself is never characterised enough for this to work; everything we learn about her is predicated on her relationship with him - there's nothing about her life prior to meeting him, and what we learn about her life after he was convicted is primarily fictional. Additionally, the focus shift halfway through as the film transitions from Liz as subjective focaliser to a more objectively focalised courtroom drama makes very little tonal sense. It's almost as if Berlinger loses interest in Liz when the sensationalist trial begins. This transition reduces Liz to a cycle of watching the trial, crying, doubting his guilt, drinking, watching the trial, crying etc, as she's effectively stripped of what little agency she had in the first half.Another problem is that we learn nothing new about Bundy himself; there's nothing about his childhood, for example, or how he got away with the murders for so long, whether he really loved Liz, or if he genuinely lacked the ability to feel empathy. Along the same lines, we learn nothing whatsoever about the victims. This was also a problem in the docu-series, but it's far more pronounced here, and because of this, the decision to put the names of his known victims on screen at the end of film is unearned, crass, and meaningless.The film also makes some strange changes to documented fact, many of which seem designed to make Bundy more sympathetic. For example, there's no mention of the fact that he tried multiple times to pressure Liz into rough sex, particularly choking. Another scene sees him forcibly restrained in his cell whilst a dentist takes impressions of his teeth. In reality, the impressions were taken in a dentist chair, and Bundy quite happily allowed the dentist to work. The film also shows him continuing to try to contact Liz throughout his incarceration. In reality, however, he lost contact with her in the early 80s, and there's no evidence he tried to find her.Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is by no means a bad film. But it could have been so much better. The shift from subjective focalisation to court-room drama makes very little sense, and fundamentally undermines what Berlinger seems to have been trying to do. The film initially looks at how evil can hide in plain view, creeping into our lives under the guise of normalcy, but Berlinger allows this theme to recede into the background as he hands the narrative over to Bundy. If this was supposed to be Liz's story, Berlinger takes his eye off the ball badly. And although the film certainly doesn't sympathise with Bundy, and although the decision not to show any of the murders is commendable, the fact is that, yet again, Ted Bundy has become very much the star of his own show.helpful•6223BertautJul 21, 2019Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ19How long is Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile?Powered by AlexaDoes anyone know the age restriction for this movie?DetailsEditRelease dateMay 3, 2019 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial site (Japan)LanguageEnglishAlso known asKẻ Cuồng Sát Biến TháiFilming locationsCovington, Kentucky, USAProduction companiesCOTA FilmsNinjas Runnin' Wild ProductionsVoltage PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditGross worldwide$9,816,572See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 50 minutesColorColorAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (2019) in India?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Great writing, great compositions, great color, great acting, good voices... splendid. Most remarkably, the range of ages who enjoyed it were from three to eight! How often does THAT happen? I will buy this for sure. Sonny Jim Bottomly, I have seen mediocre children's fair and I've even had to work on some, and this is not mediocre at all. When our recording of it from the broadcast was lost with a new audio/video installation I was actually sad about it. Now who says this is not great, huh? Let them produce even a shadow of this quality for the same budget and I will eat my robe!

Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon's Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality. What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it: incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks.  If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it's raining.  This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.  Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise's 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING.helpful•16573Jimm7yFeb 18, 1999Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ50How long is The Shining?Powered by AlexaWhat is the name of the actor who played the Man in the Bear Costume?If Stephen King hated this movie, why did he completely back a Direct Sequel to this movie?Did the movie events happen the very next winter after Grady killed his family?

When the girls are already young and beautiful women and the day comes that they are both engaged, they start to plan their perfect wedding in Plaza. Thereby the are confronted with different problems and even try to ruin each others wedding.""Bride Wars"" doesn't really stand for movies I usually watch. Although I wanted to watch it, mainly because of Anne Hathaway. I was told she is a good actress and is playing quite good in that movie. Well I can partly agree with that. Her performance in ""Bride Wars"" was surely satisfactory, however I believe her role was not really challenging. For the rest, I have to confess that the story of the movie is quite poor. It is obvious that the idea of the movie is to show us how two childhood friends deal with their friendship when their most desired dream seems to come true. However this appears unrealistic in the movie. Two best friends who know each other for over twenty years wouldn't try to spoil each others lives. ""Bride Wars"" appears also not that funny as it probably should be. The jokes are even a bit dumb and absolutely not funny.Summing up I think that ""Bride Wars"" is a motion picture made more for girls who also have bright thoughts about their wedding.helpful•2815Alex_TravellerMar 22, 2009Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ23How long is Bride Wars?Powered by AlexaIs ""The Bride Wars"" based on a book?What is the music in the trailer?Who designed Liv's wedding dress?DetailsEditRelease dateMarch 26, 2009 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asCuộc Chiến Nàng DâuFilming locationsBoston, Massachusetts, USAProduction companiesFox 2000 PicturesNew Regency ProductionsNew Regency ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$30,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$58,715,510Opening weekend US & Canada$21,058,173Jan 11, 2009Gross worldwide$115,375,850See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 29 minutesColorColorSound mixDTSDolby DigitalSDDSAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of Bride Wars (2009) in India?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

There is multiple...the colours, the music, the action and the comedy all combine to create an epic and crazily fun superhero flick. The characters are really well written and all have great chemistry with on another. Along with the dialogue this allows the characters to be quite funny and have some really strong one-liners. The villain isn't terrible either but nothing special, he's pretty much just a strong guy that works for an even stronger guy. The plot is excellent, everything fits together well and moves at a good pace which means the film is very rewatchable. The action and special effects are obviously amazing, it is a high budget marvel movie after all, what do you expect? The soundtrack tho! So good, it pairs excellently with the humour and is brilliantly placed and timed with each scene. Even the actual movie theme(not the MUSIC music) is terrifically triumphant. Coming back to the characters, what makes them so special is that each one of them has a blatantly obvious flaw that means they all have competition with each other and gives so many options when it comes to humour and overall scenes and plot.helpful•192Morejambo54Apr 15, 2021Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inWomen in Science FictionWomen in Science FictionWhether they are exploring the stars, escaping dystopias, or making the world a better place, these women are what science fiction is all about.See the galleryPhotosFAQ33How long is Guardians of the Galaxy?Powered by AlexaWhat is Guardians of the Galaxy about?Who are the Guardians of the Galaxy?Who are the villains?DetailsEditRelease dateAugust 14, 2014 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesInstagramOfficial FacebookLanguageEnglishAlso known asFull TiltFilming locationsLongcross Studios, Chobham Lane, Longcross, Chertsey, Surrey, England, UK(Studio)Production companiesMarvel StudiosWalt Disney PicturesMoving Pictures CompanySee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$170,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$333,718,600Opening weekend US & Canada$94,320,883Aug 3, 2014Gross worldwide$773,350,147See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 1 minuteColorColorSound mixDatasatDolby DigitalDolby AtmosDolby Surround 7.1Auro 11.1Aspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

1905686584715417,1,"I think i have the perfect movie for it's called ""Killers of the Flower Moon""
The movie is a western movie so not quite a mafia movie. The movie does contain violence as well as being directed by Scorsese and it also stars DiCaprio and De Nero. 
I think you will really enjoy the movie as it has all the hallmarks of a Scorsese movies with his unique story telling and extreme violence.

There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.helpful•162101CinemaSerfOct 19, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inThe Year in PostersThe Year in PostersFrom John Wick: Chapter 4 to ""Ahsoka,"" take a look back at some of our favorite posters of 2023.See the galleryPhotosFAQ19How long is Killers of the Flower Moon?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 19, 2023 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesEnglishSiouxLatinFrenchAlso known asGray HorseFilming locationsBartlesville, Oklahoma, USAProduction companiesApple StudiosImperative EntertainmentSikelia ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$200,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$67,238,555Opening weekend US & Canada$23,253,655Oct 22, 2023Gross worldwide$156,238,555See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime3 hours 26 minutesColorColorBlack and WhiteSound mixDolby AtmosDolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

48 Hrs. (pronounced 'forty-eight hours') is a 1982 American buddy cop action comedy film directed and co-written by Walter Hill, co-written by Larry Gross, Steven E. de Souza and Roger Spottiswoode, and starring Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (in his film debut) as a cop and a convict, respectively, who team up to catch two hardened criminals. The title refers to the amount of time they have to solve the crime.
Though it is predated by Richard Rush's Freebie and the Bean, the film is often credited as being the first in the ""buddy cop"" genre, later popularized by films such as Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys and Rush Hour. 48 Hrs. was Joel Silver's first title as a producer. Its supporting cast features Annette O'Toole, James Remar, Frank McRae, David Patrick Kelly, Sonny Landham, Jonathan Banks and Brion James. The musical score was composed by James Horner.
Released by Paramount Pictures on December 8, 1982, 48 Hrs. was one of the most commercially successful films of 1982,[3] and it received widespread acclaim from critics. It launched Murphy's film career and earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination for New Star of the Year – Actor. A sequel, Another 48 Hrs., was released in 1990, also directed by Walter Hill, with Nolte and Murphy reprising their roles.


Plot[edit]
Convicted career criminal Albert Ganz escapes from custody with the help of his accomplice Billy Bear. They travel to San Francisco and kill Henry Wong, a former associate. SFPD Inspector Jack Cates, accompanied by Detectives Algren and Van Zant, trace Ganz & Bear to a hotel, where they've checked in under aliases. Ganz & Bear ambush the officers. In the ensuing shootout, Ganz kills Algren & Van Zant and escapes with Billy, taking Jack's service revolver.
Armed with a replacement pistol, Jack tracks down Ganz's former partner-in-crime Reggie Hammond, who is in prison with six months to go on a three-year sentence for armed robbery. After a memorable first meeting in prison, Jack manages to get Reggie a 48-hour release into his custody so that Reggie can help Jack find Ganz & Bear. Reggie leads Jack to an apartment where Ganz's last remaining associate Luther Kelly lives. When Jack looks around, Luther shoots at him and refuses to be interrogated, so Jack arrests Luther.
That night, Reggie leads Jack to Torchy's, a redneck hangout where Billy used to be a bartender. Reggie, on a challenge from Jack, shakes the bar down using Jack's badge, single-handedly bringing the crowd under his control. They get a lead on Billy's old girlfriend, but get nothing out of her, as the girlfriend says she threw Billy out. After tensions between the two men finally erupt into a fistfight that is stopped by a pair of patrol officers, Reggie finally confesses that he, Ganz, Bear, Luther & Wong had robbed a drug dealer of $500,000 some years earlier and that the money was (and remains) stashed in the trunk of Reggie's car in a downtown parking garage. Instead of splitting the cash, Ganz sold Reggie out, resulting in his incarceration. It was also the reason why Ganz & Billy took Luther's girlfriend Rosalie: they wanted Luther to get Reggie's money in exchange for her safe return.
However, Luther goes and gets the car, and Jack & Reggie tail him to a Muni station where Ganz comes to get the money. Luther, however, recognizes Jack, and Ganz & Billy escape, while Reggie chases after Luther. Left with nothing, Jack ends up going back to the police station and waits for Reggie to call. Jack goes to a nightclub in the Fillmore District, to find Reggie, who has tracked Luther to a hotel across the street. Jack, humbled, apologizes for continuously berating and insulting Reggie. He lends Reggie some money to pay for a hotel room to have sex with a girl he's met, but as Reggie leaves the club with her, he sees Luther leave the hotel. Luther gets onto a stolen bus driven by Billy and hands over the money to Ganz, who shoots Luther and presumably Rosalie. Ganz spots Jack & Reggie following them, and a car chase/gunfight ensues, which ends when Billy forces Jack's Cadillac through the window of a Cadillac showroom. At this point following a heated verbal thrashing from Jack's superior Haden, Jack & Reggie are ready to resign themselves to the fact that they failed to catch Ganz.
At a local bar, Jack wonders if Billy might go back to see his girl and use her place as a hideout. Jack & Reggie force their way inside and after a brief confrontation, Reggie shoots Billy. Ganz escapes into a maze of alleyways, capturing Reggie. Jack approaches and shoots  Ganz in the shoulder, throwing Reggie off him. Ganz then charges at Jack but Jack shoots him repeatedly, killing him. Finally, Jack takes Reggie to go see the girl he had met earlier in Fillmore. Jack leaves the money in Reggie's car but asks for a loan to buy a convertible when Reggie is released, to which Reggie agrees. Jack gives Reggie a stern warning about changing his ways once he's released, and Reggie agrees to do so, while half attempting to steal Jack's lighter. The two men share a laugh before driving back to the prison.

Production[edit]
Development and writing[edit]
Lawrence Gordon came up with the original idea for the film.[4] The premise had the Governor of Louisiana's daughter kidnapped by a criminal, who strapped dynamite to her head and threatened to blow her up in 48 hours if the ransom was not met. The meanest cop goes to the worst prison in the state and gets out the most vicious criminal for his knowledge of the kidnapper who was his cellmate. Walter Hill says Gordon may have had the idea as far back as 1971 and a few writers worked on the project. In 1975 Gordon was making Hard Times with writer-director Walter Hill and editor Roger Spottiswoode. Spottiswoode wanted to direct and Hill suggested he break in by writing a script. He did a draft of 48 Hours supervised by Hill for Columbia Pictures, who had financed 48 Hours. Later Tracy Keenan Wynn worked on the script.[5]
The film moved from Columbia to Paramount, which wanted to do a draft for Clint Eastwood. They hired Hill to rewrite the script with Eastwood as the criminal. He did so ""but when I turned it in I said that I didn't think it would work,"" Hill said, adding ""that the best idea would be to make Richard Pryor the criminal and have someone like Eastwood play the cop. Back in '78 or '79, no one seemed to think this was such a good idea.""[5] Eastwood ended up playing a criminal in Escape from Alcatraz instead. As a result,  48 Hrs. went into limbo for two years. However, Gordon and his co-producer Joel Silver did not forget the project. Gordon called Hill and asked him if he would make the film with Nick Nolte as Cates.[4] ""Paramount felt that the combination of Nick Nolte and a good black actor would be commercial,"" said Hill. ""What happened is very simple: Richard Pryor is now an enormous movie star, and that's changed everybody's mind about black lead players.""
From the start, Hill envisioned a more improvisational film than he'd ever before created. ""The story is a traditional urban thriller: two terrible guys are out there and have to be brought down,"" he said. ""But even though I enjoy working in genres, the point is always to explode them or give them a transfusion. So I made a very conscious decision to go with the elements of personality of the two players, rather than be overly genuflective to the narrative. Thrusting a white policeman and a black convict together carries so much gravity that we didn't have to beat the white-black thing to death. If it works, it's because of the actors' personalities.""[5] Hill's first choice after Richard Pryor was Gregory Hines. When he was not available, Hill's then-girlfriend Hildy Gottlieb recommended her client, Eddie Murphy, then best known for his work on Saturday Night Live.[6] The character of Reggie Hammond was originally named Willie Biggs, but Eddie Murphy felt that was too stereotypical of a black man's name and changed it to Reggie Hammond.
Steven E. de Souza worked on the script for a few weeks after Eddie Murphy was cast. Critic Michael Sragow says ""The producers recommended de Souza to Hill because they thought he'd be good at adding a light touch to the action. Hill didn't find de Souza fast enough or his style of comic writing appropriate to the movie; he thought the writer contributed gags instead of personality touches (very few of which were used), and he just didn't develop the rapport with de Souza that he'd later have with Gross.""[5] Hill brought on Larry Gross to work on the script three weeks before shooting.[7] He told Gross ""I've been working this fella and while I like em I know it's not gonna work out...."" and called the film ""a shaggy dog story.  Defiant Ones plus chuckles.""[8]
Sragow says, ""Hill has been known throughout his career for defining character through action rather than psychological banter, but he knew that this movie would be more of a character piece than a plot picture, and he wanted a writer who'd challenge his own habits and assumptions. Throughout filming, Hill joked that he waved the flag called 'myth and archetype'—trying to play off the folkloric expectations an audience might have for a big blonde hero like Nick Nolte-while Larry Gross waved a flag called 'social and psychological realism.' The writers' relationship became so symbiotic that Gross often found Hill coming down on the side of S&PR and Gross defending the prerogatives of M&A.""[5]
Gross says his main contributions were: the idea that Reggie Hammond wanted badly to have sex after three years in prison; Nick Nolte having a relationship with his girlfriend that mirrored the frustration Eddie was having; improving ""the nuances of the relationships between Nick and his girl, his boss and the killers. The killers were sharpened up and made more interesting... Whenever Walter could invent a monologue for one of the women (all bit parts), he would."" Gross thought Hill had received ""a bum rap on the woman question."" ""One of the things I think makes 48 HRS. really more interesting than the average kind of movie like this,"" says its co-writer, ""is that, although women play relatively small roles in the narrative, they kind of haunt everyone's imagination. The film really is sort of a screwball comedy about men and women trying to get together and not getting together, even though it is a very conventional gangster piece."" ""People had this perception of Walter being melancholy,"" Gross said. ""And now that he's made this film no one thinks he's melancholy anymore.""[9]

Filming[edit]
Filming started on May 17, 1982.[10] The film was shot on-location in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Murphy started a few weeks after principal photography began because he was finishing up a season of Saturday Night Live.[4][11] The shoot went well but Hill ran into problems with studio executives. Michael Eisner, then head of Paramount, was worried that the film was not funny enough. Hill and his co-screenwriter, Larry Gross wrote more material tailored to Nolte's and Murphy's personalities. By Hill's account, they rewrote Murphy's character right to the very last day of shooting. Executives also found the footage of the gunfight in the hotel to be too violent and were worried that it would kill the film's humor. They told Hill that he would never work for Paramount again as a result.[4] Actor Chris Mulkey, said it was widely known on set that Paramount executives hated what they had seen of Murphy's performance in dailies and wanted to fire him, but Nolte and Hill fought to keep him. Mulkey remembered Murphy as a diligent performer who was open to suggestions and stuck to the script.[12]
In 2008, co-writer Larry Gross's contemporaneous diary of his days on set was published on the MovieCityNews website.[7]

Music[edit]
In January 2011, Intrada Records released the world-premiere recording of James Horner's score and songs from the movie in a limited-edition run of 5,000 units.[13] This was the first official release of the score; previous pressings from Europe were unofficial bootlegs with music from other James Horner film scores.[14]

This is a tremendously over-the-top and silly creature-feature, but the undemanding popcorn-entertainment value is just irresistible. The original King Kong, from 1933 already, is a monumental piece of cinema and still very powerful today. The more recent (2005) and expensive Peter Jackson remake was, at least in my humble opinion, a very boring and overlong romantic drama. ""Kong: Skull Island"" nicely falls right between these two extremes. By no means, it's great cinema, but at least it provides thrills, chuckles and adrenaline rushes from start to finish. The intro and scene-setting are already incredibly dumb, but oh so fun! We're supposed to believe that there exists a secret government agency (yes, another one) named Monarch, and their area of expertise is searching around the world for monsters and oversize animals. In 1973, The agency's CEO (an energetic John Goodman) benefices from the US-army's retreat out of Vietnam to recover soldiers and assets for a mission to the secretive Skull Island; a place where - and I quote - God left his creation unfinished.""Kong: Skull Island"" certainly doesn't waste any time! The helicopters have barely begun circling over the island, and there already emerges the humongous ape King Kong to slap them out of the sky like tiny ping-pong balls! The few remaining soldiers, led by the frustrated platoon leader Samuel L. Jackson, continue on foot and swear to destroy King Kong, but they soon learn that the island homes lots of other giant and unspeakably evil monstrous creations, and that Kong isn't even such a bad fella. It's a mission impossible to take this film seriously, but with the right mindset (and perhaps a few six-packs of beer) you'll have a great time. Seeing the story takes place in 1973 and has an abundantly clear Vietnam collection, it also somewhat feels like a long-feature ""Tour of Duty"" movie with a downright awesome 70s soundtrack. The special effects are cheesy and exaggerated, the dialogues are deliciously tacky (""hm, a mushroom...that means there must a river nearby!"") and the casting is perfect. I already mentioned John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson, but there's also John C. Reilly as the bewildered WWII veteran who's been stuck on the island since 1942.helpful•60CoventryNov 22, 2019Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ22How long is Kong: Skull Island?Powered by AlexaIs this a sequel to Peter Jackson's ""King Kong""?Is Kong as big as Godzilla?DetailsEditRelease dateMarch 9, 2017 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesChinaOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial siteLanguagesEnglishVietnameseAlso known asSkull IslandFilming locationsHa Long Bay, Quang Bình Province, Vietnam(aerial shots of Skull Island)Production companiesWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentTencent PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$185,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$168,052,812Opening weekend US & Canada$61,025,472Mar 12, 2017Gross worldwide$568,652,812See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 58 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackDolby AtmosDolby Surround 7.1Auro 11.1Aspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Well, the twist here is that the lead protagonist is deaf and mute from her teens and the director-writer combo of Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel (who also happen to be husband-wife in real life), places this character in a stuck-up situation where a killer is on the prowl and all odds are stacked against her. Questions start piling up but a good thirty minutes into the film, the viewer is given enough leads to estimate where the film is headed.A film such as this, where the entire scenario revolves around a minimalist location, one feels inclined to applaud director Flanagan's knack for not making the film look like yet another typical home-invasion flick. The protagonist Maddie's inability to speak or hear is put to good effect in the screenplay. I won't spoil those brilliantly written and choreographed scenes in this review, because that is exactly what puts this flick a few notches above the rest in the genre. Equally inventive and enthralling are those scenes where Maddie's imaginative capability is put to test.The cast (that comprises of just four characters, out of which the film revolves majorly around two!) is adequate as well, and lends ample support to the overall mainstay of the flick. Flanagan's directorial skills, which looked rather unimpressive in Absentia (2011), after which he made a notable Oculus (2013), has considerably improved over the years, all the while sticking to modest production expenditure. Aided in writing by his wife Kate Siegel, the couple seem poised to astonish us yet again this year in the sequel to the strictly sub- par Ouija (2014).Hush is a pleasant surprise amongst the shitload of low-budget slasher garbage that is handed out to us every now and then. It is by all means worth a watch for thriller buffs.helpful•3324arungeorge13Jun 5, 2017Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateApril 8, 2016 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesEnglishAmerican Sign LanguageAlso known asSukunatFilming locationsFairhope, Alabama, USAProduction companiesIntrepid PicturesBlumhouse ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$1,000,000 (estimated)See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 22 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to Hush (2016) in Mexico?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

The only thing I had heard about it was that my sister-in-law told us not to see it because it was bawdy and she walked out, so right away I knew it was worth watching. This movie was nothing like we thought it was going to be like--it was a fantastic and quite involving drama, which deserved a few Oscars. The time frames from the early 70's to the mid 80's were flawless, and the ""glamor"" of the porn industry was effectively dispelled by the portrayal of the stars. One of the most memorable scenes of all times, in my opinion was the drug deal gone bad, the firecrackers, the guy in the bathrobe and the utter uneasiness of the deposed porn stars as we listened to ""Jessie's Girl"" and ""Sister Christian"". Burt Reynolds was great as Jack Horner, the director who made money with young energy and the coming trends, but realized he had to be ""father"" to all those aging stars who had nowhere else to go once the bright lights began to flicker and the money was getting thin.helpful•536Ari-8Jan 17, 1999Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ12What is Rollergirl's real name?What was the inspiration for this story?Were any of the characters based on real life people?DetailsEditRelease dateMarch 19, 1998 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial siteWarner Bros (United States)LanguageEnglishAlso known asPushing ThirteenFilming locations19515 East Cameron Avenue, West Covina, California, USA(Jack Horner's house)Production companiesNew Line CinemaLawrence Gordon ProductionsGhoulardi Film CompanySee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$15,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$26,416,349Opening weekend US & Canada$50,168Oct 12, 1997Gross worldwide$43,117,303See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 35 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalSDDSAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of Boogie Nights (1997) in Canada?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

A 50's B-movie revival! Stephen Colbert as the President! Hugh Laurie as a cockroach! I mean, it's called Monsters vs. Aliens!!!What I got was a mildly good movie. I mean, there were some nice gags in the Strangelove- lite War Room, and some great lines from BOB, but it really left me wanting more. As a whole, the film never got to the comical heights of Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, or even Shrek 2. There are times in the movie where you know that they are going completely random to try and get some laughs, but fail pretty badly. Besides comedy, the story itself is pretty predictable. From the moment you meet the monsters you know what the moral of the story, and you know pretty much how the whole film will play out. But it is not a bad film. Not at all. It's good, but not great. What IS great is the 3D. Me, I've never really warmed to 3D, but they use it here in a completely different sense. Monster's vs Alien's 3D is not about shouting ""OMG I CAN TOUCH HIS BEARD!!"", but more about perspective. And hair. I'm sorry but it's worth seeing just for Ginormica's (Susan's) hair alone. So basically, it's fun - but not as fun as it should have been. And take it from me: even if you're cynical about 3D; see it in 3D. It's worth the ticket price alone.helpful•12180pberkoMar 14, 2009Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ22How long is Monsters vs. Aliens?Powered by AlexaWhat dose B.O.B. stand for?What is ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" about?Why didn't Ginormica's hair go back to being brown after it turned white?DetailsEditRelease dateApril 1, 2009 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesCanadaOfficial sitesDreamWorks Animation (United States)Official FacebookLanguagesEnglishPortugueseAlso known asCreature FeatureProduction companiesDreamWorks AnimationPacific Data Images (PDI)See more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$175,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$198,351,526Opening weekend US & Canada$59,321,095Mar 29, 2009Gross worldwide$381,509,870See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 34 minutesColorColorSound mixSDDSDTSDolby DigitalAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of Monsters vs. Aliens (2009) in India?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Tom Cruise has done every type of movie you can think of over his nearly 40-year career.
Here we rank every one from worst to best.
See where his latest, ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,"" ranks in his career filmography.

43. ""Rock of Ages"" (2012)










                                                Cruise in ""Rock of Ages.""
                                              

                                                  Warner Bros.
                                                


Somehow Cruise got roped into being part of this feature-film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical. But leave it to him to lay it all out there.Though the movie is unwatchable, Cruise provides its only memorable moments when his rock-star character belts out classic songs like ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" and ""Wanted Dead or Alive.""

42. ""Endless Love"" (1981)










                                                Cruise in ""Endless Love.""
                                              

                                                  Universal Pictures
                                                


Cruise's first appearance in a movie is this 1980s teen romance drama starring Brooke Shields that's best known for giving us the Diana Ross/Lionel Richie title song.Cruise gets a brief bit of screen time as one of the male lead's friends. It's quite forgettable, but it's still better than ""Rock of Ages.""

41. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016)










                                                Cruise in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.""
                                              

                                                  Focus World
                                                


Between ""Mission: Impossible"" movies, Cruise tried to kick off another action franchise by bringing the main character of the Lee Child novel series to the big screen.Though the first movie just got over the $200 million mark at the worldwide box office, the performance (or lack thereof) by the sequel indicated no one wanted any more Mr. Reacher. It barely made $162 million worldwide.







40. ""The Mummy"" (2017)










                                                Annabelle Wallis and Cruise in ""The Mummy.""
                                              

                                                  Universal
                                                


Cruise was all set to be the Robert Downey Jr. of Universal's Dark Universe with the release of this movie and promises of more creature pictures to come. But playing a soldier of fortune who tries to stop an ancient Egyptian princess from taking over the world didn't grab audiences. It was another franchise not meant to be.

39. ""Losin' It"" (1983)










                                                John Stockwell and Cruise in ""Losin' It.""
                                              

                                                  Embassy Pictures Corporation
                                                


Still getting his legs under him in the movie biz, Cruise signed onto this teen comedy in which he's one of four friends who go on a hard-partying road trip to Tijuana in hopes of losing their virginity. Yes, even Cruise couldn't hide from the teen-sex-comedy genre when he started his career.

38. ""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000)










                                                Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible II.""
                                              

                                                  YouTube/Paramount Pictures
                                                


Man, John Woo deserved better than this. The legendary Hong Kong director took over the ""Mission: Impossible"" reins after Brian De Palma kicked things off with the first movie, but Woo didn't find the same success.""Mission: Impossible II"" did go on to become one of the highest-grossing movies of 2000, with over $546 million earned worldwide, but with its weak plot and character development, it has not aged anywhere near as well as the first movie (or the other movies in the franchise).

37. ""Jack Reacher"" (2012)










                                                Cruise in ""Jack Reacher.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                


Though ""Jack Reacher"" was the first time Cruise worked with his longtime ""Mission: Impossible"" director, Christopher McQuarrie, and it features the legendary director Werner Herzog as the movie's villain, Cruise as Jack Reacher is a seen-it-before character who isn't exciting.







36. ""Oblivion"" (2013)










                                                Cruise in ""Oblivion.""
                                              

                                                  Universal Pictures
                                                


Here, Cruise attempted to go the sci-fi route in hopes of having a breakthrough ""Minority Report""-like experience for the audience. But the story was nowhere as sharp, and its postapocalyptic vibe left us all feeling uninterested.

35. ""Lions for Lambs"" (2007)










                                                Cruise in ""Lions for Lambs.""
                                              

                                                  MGM
                                                


Marking the first movie released by United Artists after Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner took over (the two left UA after a couple of years) was ""Lions for Lambs,"" a tense drama set around the war in Afghanistan and directed by Robert Redford.Cruise gave his all playing an agenda-pushing senator and has some strong scenes opposite Meryl Streep. But the movie is just dull.







34. ""Far and Away"" (1992)










                                                Nicole Kidman and Cruise in ""Far and Away.""
                                              

                                                  Universal Pictures
                                                


Cruise and his wife at the time, Nicole Kidman, paired together in this 1890s-set epic directed by Ron Howard. The two play Irish immigrants seeking a fortune in America. Outside the lush photography, there isn't much to enjoy about this movie. And don't get me started on Cruise's awful Irish accent.

33. ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)










                                                Penélope Cruz and Cruise in ""Vanilla Sky.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                


At the tail end of Cruise's heartthrob phase, the director Cameron Crowe teamed with him again after their hugely successful collaboration on ""Jerry Maguire"" to make a very different love story.Based on the Spanish movie ""Open Your Eyes,"" Cruise plays a vain New York City media playboy who has a different outlook on life after being in a horrific car crash. Though Cruise, Cameron Diaz, and Penélope Cruz (who also starred in ""Open Your Eyes"") all give top performances, Crowe goes too weird with the story, leaving viewers out in the void by the time the movie gets into the home stretch.







32. ""American Made"" (2017)










                                                Cruise and Sarah Wright in ""American Made.""
                                              

                                                  Universal Pictures
                                                


Mixing action and dark comedy in telling the real-life story of the drug runner Barry Seal seemed like a nice pivot for Cruise, but at the end of the day, the director Doug Liman's movie is just too glossy to be taken seriously. (Accent update: Cruise delivers a tolerable Southern drawl.)

31. ""The Last Samurai"" (2003)










                                                Cruise in ""The Last Samurai.""
                                              

                                                  Warner Bros. Pictures
                                                


Cruise stars as an American soldier in 19th-century Japan who embraces the samurai culture. The movie went on to receive four Oscar nominations, but it's the kind of title in which one viewing is enough.And on a side note: Wow, would this movie get hammered on social media if it came out today.

30. ""Valkyrie"" (2008)










                                                Cruise in ""Valkyrie.""
                                              

                                                  MGM
                                                


Another release from the time Cruise was calling the shots at UA, ""Valkyrie"" sees him playing one of the rogue Nazi officers who attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler.(Accent update: Cruise — and basically most of the other Nazi officers — decided to not even bother with a German accent. Good choice; the audience didn't even notice [holds back giggles].)

29. ""Cocktail"" (1988)










                                                Elisabeth Shue and Cruise in ""Cocktail.""
                                              

                                                  Buena Vista Pictures
                                                


It's one of the movies in Cruise's career that ride fully on his good looks. Honestly, this movie should have just been titled ""Sex."" Cruise plays a hot New York City bartender who has dreams of making it big, and it's his hotness that's going to get him to the top. It's classic Hot Guy Cruise — who cares that the story is garbage.







28. ""War of the Worlds"" (2005)










                                                Cruise and Dakota Fanning in ""War of the Worlds.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                


Steven Spielberg teamed up with Cruise after ""Minority Report"" for this blockbuster remake of the classic sci-fi movie. Though it made a lot of money, it was dark in tone — maybe a little too dark. Be honest: Have you wanted to see this movie again?

27. ""Knight and Day"" (2010)










                                                Cameron Diaz and Cruise in ""Knight and Day.""
                                              

                                                  Fox
                                                


This is one of those movies that don't get enough credit. The director James Mangold cleverly takes all the common action-hero traits and has Cruise make fun of them. You might want to give this one another viewing.







26. ""Taps"" (1981)










                                                Cruise in ""Taps.""
                                              

                                                  20th Century Fox
                                                


Unlike in ""Endless Love,"" Cruise really capitalized on this small role. As a military cadet who takes his responsibilities way too seriously, Cruise is a standout in the movie and showed audiences (and Hollywood executives) that he had leading-man potential.

25. ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006)










                                                Cruise and Michelle Monaghan in ""Mission: Impossible III.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                


J.J. Abrams takes over the franchise for this one and does an impressive job. It also helps that you have the talents of Philip Seymour Hoffman playing the villain. It's better than ""Mission: Impossible II,"" so we're going in the right direction.







24. ""The Outsiders"" (1983)










                                                Francis Ford Coppola cast the heck out of ""The Outsiders.""
                                              

                                                  Warner Brothers
                                                


Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of the classic novel brought all the biggest names from young Hollywood together, and Cruise was right there in the mix. With Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Emilio Estevez, and Rob Lowe, the movie is pretty heavy-handed with the drama, but it's fun to watch all these amazing talents on the screen together.

23. ""Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation"" (2015)










                                                Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation.""
                                              


                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                    



Rebounding from the so-so performance of ""Jack Reacher,"" McQuarrie jumps on the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise and ups the action stakes. Yep, this is the one where Cruise hangs from the side of a giant plane taking off. The movie also got an extra jolt with the inclusion of Rebecca Ferguson in the supporting cast.







22. ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout"" (2018)










                                                Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Cruise, and Ving Rhames in ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                


This ""Mission: Impossible"" could go down as one of the best action movies ever — its stunts and action sequences are that amazing. This time, McQuarrie gives us a deeper look at what makes Ethan Hunt tick and the values he lives by. But it's really the action that stays with you.

21. ""Minority Report"" (2002)










                                                Cruise in ""Minority Report.""
                                              

                                                  20th Century Fox
                                                


With its breakthroughs in CGI and tech, the first teaming of Spielberg and Cruise lived up to the hype. This movie was so advanced in its execution and what it showcased that it had a ""Jurassic Park""-style ripple effect, in the sense that it has influenced countless action and sci-fi movies since.







20. ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008)










                                                Cruise and Matthew McConaughey in ""Tropic Thunder.""
                                              

                                                  DreamWorks Pictures/Paramount Pictures
                                                


Though Cruise doesn't have a lot of screen time, his presence in this movie cannot be ignored. Playing a despicable movie executive named Les Grossman, he brings that patented intensity to a role that for most actors would have been a mail-it-in cameo role. In Cruise's hands, it's one of the best comedic performances of the early 2000s.

19. ""All the Right Moves"" (1983)










                                                Cruise in ""All the Right Moves.""
                                              

                                                  20th Century Fox
                                                


Two months after Cruise hit theaters with his first lead movie, ""Risky Business,"" he was back again with this very different movie about a Pennsylvania high-school football player who clashes with his coach.""Risky Business"" showed that Cruise had no problem being the face of a movie, but ""All the Right Moves"" proved he could be more than the charming lead with good looks. This one showed he could be a serious actor.

18. ""Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol"" (2011)










                                                Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount
                                                


It's the movie that breathed life back into the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise. It came five years after ""Mission: Impossible III,"" and in that time Cruise struggled with an image problem and a string of underperforming movies. He had a lot to prove with this one. And with the casting of Jeremy Renner, Cruise probably sensed he could lose his beloved franchise if the movie didn't work.However, Brad Bird's direction and Cruise's disregard for common sense — in this one he climbs the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai — put him back on top, as the movie became a global hit.

17. ""Top Gun"" (1986)










                                                Cruise in ""Top Gun"" (yep, that's Tim Robbins behind him).
                                              

                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                


Before ""Days of Thunder,"" Cruise and Tony Scott teamed up for what would become one of the actor's most iconic roles: the fighter pilot Maverick. What Cruise doesn't pull off acting-wise he makes up for with brooding looks and shirtless volleyball skills.







16. ""The Firm"" (1993)










                                                Cruise in ""The Firm.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount Picture
                                                


In ""The Firm,"" based on the best-selling John Grisham novel, Cruise gives a fantastic performance as a hotshot lawyer who signs on with one of the most prestigious US law firms only to find it has quite a dark side. The era of ""Tom Cruise runs"" really launched with this movie.

15. ""Legend"" (1985)










                                                Mia Sara and Cruise in ""Legend.""
                                              

                                                  Universal Pictures
                                                


Ridley Scott's beautiful fantasy movie is still a marvel of moviemaking. The practical effects and production design put into this movie, made back when CGI was scarce, are a treasure. And at the center is a fresh-faced Cruise who tries to get his girl back from the villain who gave me the most nightmares as a kid, Darkness (played perfectly by Tim Curry).







14. ""Collateral"" (2004)










                                                Cruise in ""Collateral.""
                                              

                                                  Dreamworks
                                                


We really don't talk enough about this one enough. Michael Mann's slow-burn crime movie stars Cruise as a hitman who forces a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to drive him around Los Angeles as he goes on his ""jobs."" The acting by both Cruise and Foxx in this movie is some of their best work.

13. ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" (2023)










                                                Tom Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount
                                                


There are many things to love about the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise: Its James Bond-like gadgets. Cruise's disregard for his life and safety when it comes to pulling off amazing stunts. But the biggest thing to love is that the films just seem to get better and better.The first ""M:I,"" directed by Brian De Palma, set the bar very high. However, since McQuarrie took the reins in 2015 with ""Rogue Nation,"" the franchise has gotten a jolt in the arm. It seems to always outdo itself, and ""Dead Reckoning"" makes good on that promise.The high stakes, the timely villain being AI, and, of course, Tom Cruise in the middle of some amazing thrills makes this film one of the best in the franchise.







13. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999)










                                                Nicole Kidman and Cruise in ""Eyes Wide Shut.""
                                              

                                                  Warner Bros.
                                                


Cruise and Kidman teamed up again, this time under the watch of Stanley Kubrick in what would be his final movie. Both actors are pushed to the limits as the movie explores a marriage at a crossroads. Though ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not close to Kubrick's best work, Cruise and Kidman are riveting.

12. ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2022)










                                                ""Top Gun: Maverick.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount
                                                


Thirty-six years after playing Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell he returns to the role in the rare legacy sequel that's better than the original movie.Though Tony Scott's landmark ""Top Gun"" made Cruise a superstar and became an instant 1980s classic, the director Joseph Kosinski has elevated the story with more death-defying dogfight jet stunts and a more compelling story.This time Maverick returns to the Top Gun school to be a teacher of the new hot-shot pilots. But he must deal with his own demons as one of the students is the son of his best friend, Goose, who died in his arms in the first movie.Cruise delivers one of his best performances in years.







11. ""Days of Thunder"" (1990)










                                                Cruise in ""Days of Thunder.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                


It's pretty much everything you would think would be in a Tony Scott movie: lots of fast cars and big egos. Cruise is in his glory in every scene playing the hot-shot Nascar driver Cole Trickle (and Kidman appears as his love interest).

10. ""Risky Business"" (1983)










                                                Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business.""
                                              

                                                  Warner Bros. Pictures
                                                


It's the movie that made Cruise a star. The coming-of-age story doesn't shy away from its mature storyline, and Cruise delivers a playful performance but also shows sparks of his dramatic chops that he'll showcase in the decade to come.

9. ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996)










                                                Tom Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible.""
                                              

                                                  Paramount Pictures
                                                


Boy have things changed since the first ""Mission: Impossible."" With De Palma at the helm, the movie had its action, but it was encased in a tense whodunit thriller. Since then the action has only gotten bigger (and the story, well, less of a concern), but Cruise has always been fantastic as Hunt.The first movie is his best acting work of the franchise. (Accent update: Cruise delivers another Southern accent while disguised at the beginning of the movie — one of those classic face-rip-off disguises. It's brief but effective in the scene.)

8. ""Interview with the Vampire"" (1994)










                                                Cruise in ""Interview with the Vampire.""
                                              

                                                  Warner Bros.
                                                


Cruise gives one of his best performances as Lestat, a vampire from the 1700s who finds a lot of drama in his undead life once he recruits Louis (Brad Pitt). (Accent update: His little hint of a French accent to stay true to the character's portrayal in the classic Anne Rice book is perfectly subtle.)







7. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014)










                                                Cruise and Emily Blunt in ""Edge of Tomorrow.""
                                              

                                                  Warner Bros.
                                                


Whether you want to call it ""Edge of Tomorrow"" or ""Live. Die. Repeat.,"" it's just a really great action movie. With Liman directing and McQuarrie as a screenwriter, Cruise is surrounded by people he trusts to make a risky project: a soldier who relives the same day. But the MVP of the movie is Emily Blunt, who delivers a performance that makes Cruise kick it up a few notches.

6. ""Rain Man"" (1988)










                                                Dustin Hoffman and Cruise in ""Rain Man.""
                                              

                                                  United Artists
                                                


Always at his best when he's playing a character with major conflict, Cruise plays a guy always looking to capitalize on the angles until he's finally in a situation in which he has to be on the level: building a relationship with his autistic savant brother (Dustin Hoffman).







5. ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996)










                                                Cruise in ""Jerry Maguire.""
                                              

                                                  Sony Pictures Releasing
                                                


Receiving a best-actor nomination for his performance as a slick sports agent whose life turns upside down after having a moment of clarity, Cruise was, thanks to this movie, at his height of stardom and power in Hollywood.

4. ""A Few Good Men"" (1992)

Rob Reiner's courtroom drama has Cruise going up against Jack Nicholson, and it's pure magic. Yes, there's the ""can't handle the truth"" scene, but for us, it starts earlier in the movie when the two characters meet for the first time.Thanks to the incredible dialogue by Aaron Sorkin, both actors subtly trade off with each other, but it's the fire being held back that makes the ending when they are face-to-face again so memorable.

No matter what you think of Paul Thomas Anderson's epic look at family, love, and forgiveness, it's hard to dispute that it has the most powerful performance of Cruise's career.Playing a pickup artist who uses his talents to build a public-speaking career, Cruise appears as we've never seen him before. Anderson and Cruise connected over dealing with the loss of their fathers and use that darkness to create the character of Frank T. J. Mackey.

2. ""The Color of Money"" (1986)










                                                Paul Newman and Cruise in ""The Color of Money.""
                                              

                                                  Buena Vista Distribution
                                                


Paul Newman won only one Oscar in his iconic career, and it was for this movie. But you have to give a big assist to Cruise.Playing the protégé to the pool player ""Fast Eddie"" Felson — the role Newman first played in 1961's ""The Hustler"" — Cruise is a cocky player, and you can never tell whether he's on the level with Felson. Cruise proved once again that he's more than just a pretty face.

Cruise got an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the veteran and activist Ron Kovic, who was paralyzed fighting in Vietnam. Oliver Stone traces Kovic's journey from being a wide-eyed soldier thinking he's doing what's right for America to coming home from the war to find everything has changed. Including the way he views his own country.Cruise has never been better as he delivers a tour de force performance that still gives us chills.

The Boy and the Heron (Japanese: 君たちはどう生きるか, Hepburn: Kimitachi wa Dō Ikiru ka, lit. 'How Do You[a] Live?') is a 2023 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Produced by Studio Ghibli, the Japanese title references Genzaburō Yoshino's 1937 novel of the same name, which briefly appears in the film, but the film has an original story that is not connected to the novel. The Japanese voice cast includes Soma Santoki, Masaki Suda, Ko Shibasaki, Aimyon, Yoshino Kimura, Takuya Kimura, Kaoru Kobayashi, and Shinobu Otake. Described as a ""big fantastical film"", it follows a boy named Mahito Maki during the Pacific War who discovers an abandoned tower in his new town after his mother's death and enters a fantastical world with a talking grey heron.

Miyazaki announced his retirement in September 2013 but later reversed this decision after working on the short film Boro the Caterpillar, which was released in 2018. He began storyboarding for a new feature-length project in July 2016, and official production began in May 2017. The film's title was announced in October 2017, targeting a release around the 2020 Summer Olympics. By May 2020, 36 minutes of the film had been hand-drawn by 60 animators, with no set deadline. Production spanned approximately seven years, facing delays as it navigated challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and Miyazaki's slowed animation pace, before nearing completion in October 2022. Financing for the project involved streaming deals for previous Ghibli films. According to producer Toshio Suzuki, The Boy and the Heron is the most expensive film ever produced in Japan. The screenplay draws heavily from Miyazaki's childhood, and explores themes of coming of age and coping with a world marked by conflict and loss. Joe Hisaishi composed the film's score, while Kenshi Yonezu wrote and sang the film's theme song ""Spinning Globe"".

The Boy and the Heron was theatrically released in Japan on July 14, 2023, by Toho, and was screened in both traditional theaters and other premium formats such as IMAX. The release of the film was noted for its intentional absence of any promotion, with Ghibli choosing not to release any trailers, images, synopsis or casting details of the film in advance of its Japanese premiere with the exception of a single poster. The film received critical acclaim and has grossed over US$159 million worldwide. Among its numerous accolades, it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.

Plot
During the Pacific War in Tokyo, Mahito Maki loses his mother Hisako in a hospital fire. Mahito's father Shoichi, an air munitions factory owner, marries his late wife's sister, Natsuko. They evacuate to her rural estate. Mahito, distant to the pregnant Natsuko, encounters a peculiar grey heron leading him to a sealed tower, the last known location of Natsuko's architect granduncle.

After a school fight, Mahito deliberately injures himself. The heron, now speaking, entices Mahito with promises of finding his mother. Mahito is nearly taken by a supernatural swarm of toads but Natsuko saves him with a whistling arrow, inspiring him to craft his own bow and arrow. The arrow is magically imbued with true aim after it is fletched with the heron's feather. Mahito's reading of a book left by Hisako is interrupted when ill Natsuko disappears into the forest. Leading one of the estate's elderly maids, Kiriko, into the tower, Mahito is deceived by a watery imitation of his mother made by the heron, which dissolves at his touch. Affronted, he pierces the heron's beak with his arrow, revealing a flightless creature, the Birdman, living inside it. A wizard appears, ordering Birdman to guide Mahito and Kiriko as all three sink into the floor.

Mahito descends into an oceanic world. He is rescued from attacking pelicans and a forbidding, megalithic dolmen by a younger Kiriko, an adept fisherwoman who uses fire through a magic wand. They catch and sell a giant fish to bubble-like spirits called Warawara, which fly to the world above to be reborn. A pyrokinetic young woman, Himi, protects Warawara from predation by the pelicans. A dying pelican explains that their species is desperate to survive after being introduced to this world with no other food. Kiriko mediates peace between Mahito and the Birdman, and Mahito plugs Birdman's beak, restoring his flight. The two are separated by anthropomorphic, man-eating parakeets. Himi saves Mahito and shows him a counterpart of the tower which contains doors to many worlds. They enter a door leading back to Natsuko's estate and are found by Shoichi, but Mahito returns through the door to continue his search for Natsuko.

Infiltrating the parakeets' kingdom, Mahito finds Natsuko in a delivery room. When Natsuko rebuffs him, he acknowledges her as his mother. Himi incinerates the paper attacking them but all three are rendered unconscious by the encounter. In a dream, Mahito meets the wizard, Natsuko's granduncle. The wizard, preoccupied by a stack of stone toy blocks representing their dimension, requests Mahito, possessing the power of his bloodline, to succeed to custodianship of this world. Mahito notices that the blocks are infused with malice. Waking up, he is freed from captivity by Birdman. They climb the tower to pursue the Parakeet King, who is delivering Himi to the wizard as a political bargaining chip. The wizard has collected replacement blocks free of malice for Mahito, and implores him to build a better world with them, but Mahito states that he himself possesses malice, embodied by his self-inflicted scar. He refuses, saying that he must first embrace those who love him.

Enraged by the frivolity of the toy blocks, the Parakeet King slices them apart. The world begins to collapse and flood, and Mahito, Himi, and Birdman escape, reuniting with Natsuko and young Kiriko. Learning that Himi is his birth mother, Mahito warns her of her fate, but Himi returns to her own time without regrets. Mahito returns with Natsuko, amidst an exodus of animals that revert to non-anthropomorphic forms. Birdman notices Mahito keeping a stone of power, and advises him to forget his experiences. A charm doll carried by Mahito transforms back into the old Kiriko. Two years later, Mahito moves back to Tokyo with Shoichi, Natsuko, and his new half-sibling.

Themes
The Boy and the Heron has autobiographical features. The protagonist, Mahito Maki, is modeled after Miyazaki's childhood. Miyazaki's father, similar to Mahito's father, was employed by a company involved in the manufacturing of fighter plane components. Additionally, Miyazaki's family had to evacuate from the city to the countryside during the war.[4][b] The hospital fire at the beginning of the film evokes personal parallels with Miyazaki's own loss of his mother,[6] who was known for her strong opinions and is believed to have been a source of inspiration for several of the director's female characters, and Mahito's emotional connection with his mother parallels Miyazaki's love for his mother.[7] The BBC defined the film as ""a coming-of-age tale in which a child must overcome his selfishness and learn to live for others.""[8]

Suzuki spoke of Miyazaki's desire to create the film based on personal experiences and relationships when he proposed it in 2016. He was initially taken aback, given Miyazaki's avoidance of highly personal themes. The narrative is inspired by Miyazaki's (Mahito) professional relationships with Isao Takahata (Granduncle) and Suzuki (Heron), and integrates themes of destruction, reconstruction and imagination. Following Takahata's death in 2018, revisions were made to the film, shifting the focus from the Granduncle to the relationship between Mahito and Heron. Suzuki observed that Miyazaki's storytelling choices were deeply influenced by the memories shared between the two.[9]

Taichiro Yoshino, the grandson of Genzaburō Yoshino, confessed to being somewhat bewildered by the film's messages. He also mentioned a meeting he had attended at Studio Ghibli's offices in 2017, during which Miyazaki articulated his intention to create the film and acknowledged his past works, primarily featuring cheerful and optimistic male protagonists, and contrasted them with his perception of boys as complex individuals. Miyazaki aimed to depict a protagonist who grapples with inner conflicts and insecurities, emphasizing the transformative power of overcoming personal challenges. Yoshino drew a distinction between The Boy and the Heron and Kimitachi wa Dō Ikiru ka as separate works, yet highlighted their shared central theme—how individuals navigate and come to terms with a world characterized by strife and loss.[10][4]

The film contains the message of creating ""a world without conflict with your own hands.""[10] According to The Japan Times, Miyazaki's faith in children's potential to surpass previous generations under challenging circumstances is exemplified in the film's Japanese title, which offers children a choice between emulating the chaos of Japan's past war or forging a better path, and thus demonstrates the ""continued optimism"" that serves as the ""greatest testament"" to the director's imagination.[7] The Hollywood Reporter noted that the film retains elements of the book that emphasize the theme of spiritual growth. The film, open to diverse interpretations, fundamentally conveys resilience in the face of conflict and grief, while advocating for the cultivation of meaningful friendships and trustworthy alliances, ultimately promoting progress and fostering ""humanity and understanding to the world.""[11] IndieWire's analysis argues that the film weaves together various thematic layers and tonal elements drawn from Miyazaki's past work. It draws attention to the film's departure from the conventional children's genre, instead aligning more closely with the ""violent"" style of Princess Mononoke rather than the ""cuddly charm"" of My Neighbor Totoro, with the exception of the Warawara characters.[6]

A review on RogerEbert.com asserts that the film's narrative explores themes of ""acceptance, redemption, and the power of creation"", drawing explicit connections between Miyazaki's youthful inspirations and his hopes of inspiring others over four decades. The film delves into the juxtaposition of life and death, wherein childhood and the end of life can serve as reflective counterparts.[12] As highlighted by Unseen Japan, the film's themes make the viewer reflect on their role in a world marked by violence and uncertainty, their obligations to future generations and their connection to their ancestors.[13] This view is shared by some publications, commenting that Miyazaki's recurring exploration of mortality and the aftermath of profound loss is a central theme in the film, showing the importance of everyday choices and depicting a journey of self-discovery and the search for meaning amidst the uncertainties of life,[14][15] and underlining the film's open-ended approach in contrast to the book centered on the moral development of adolescent boys. The narrative imparts various moral lessons but centers on an ""impassioned plea"" from an aging master (Granduncle) to his progeny, emphasizing the urgency of their tasks as time passes quickly.[16]

For Nikkei Asia, the primary emotional driver in the film is the yearning for a mother's presence. This emotion fuels the narrative, occasionally diverting into adventures involving fantastical creatures. Mahito's father marries his mother's sister, evoking significant Freudian undertones. Miyazaki emphasizes the child's perspective, sometimes with quasi-sexual elements, as seen in encounters with frogs. Such moments, though evocative, are brief and dreamlike. The film stands as one of Miyazaki's less textured works, focusing on Mahito's mission to save his mother and stepmother, emblematic of Miyazaki's recurring theme of worthiness.[17] Fiction Horizon referred Mahito as resonant and inspiring, associating these traits with his resilience, vulnerability, and transformative growth.[18]

Vulture noted that despite the serious narrative of the multi-themed film, it deliberately includes scenes of bird droppings, which provides comic relief, and which it felt were in line with Miyazaki's broader message about the messy and natural aspects of life as opposed to the oppressive order of Imperial Japan depicted in the film.[19]

Production

Director Hayao Miyazaki in 2009

Producer Toshio Suzuki in 2004
Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki held a press conference in Venice in September 2013 announcing his retirement from feature animation, saying: ""I know I've said I would retire many times in the past. Many of you must think, 'Once again.' But this time I am quite serious.""[20][21] However, Miyazaki later changed his mind after concluding work on the short film Boro the Caterpillar (2018) and decided to come out of retirement to direct another full-length film, a decision which was captured in the 2016 documentary film Never-Ending Man: Hayao Miyazaki.[22][23] He commenced storyboarding for the film in July 2016 and presented a project proposal for it the next month.[24] This proposal included a children's novel The Book of Lost Things by Irish author John Connolly, which formed ""a loose framework"" for the project. Edogawa Ranpo's Ghost Tower (幽霊塔, Yūrei-tō), which Miyazaki loved as a child, inspired the tower in the film.[25][26] Suzuki later approved the project, taking into account Miyazaki's commitment and storyboard work.[9] After Suzuki publicly announced the start of work on Miyazaki's new film in February 2017,[27] the studio's official website posted a call for staff for the new project on May 19, 2017, and production began in earnest.[28] With Miyazaki coming out of retirement, Studio Ghibli reopened with many of its past collaborators working on the project.[29] At an event held at Waseda University in October 2017, Studio Ghibli announced the film would be titled Kimitachi wa Dō Ikiru ka, after the 1937 novel of the same name by Genzaburo Yoshino.[30][31] The release date was not determined, but Miyazaki voiced his desire to release the film around the time of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan.[24] Suzuki said that Miyazaki is working on the film for his grandson as his way of saying ""Grandpa is moving on to the next world, but he's leaving behind this film.""[32]

Suzuki stated in August 2018 that the film was expected to be completed in 2021 or 2022. The film was confirmed to be 15% complete at the end of October 2019. In a December 2019 interview with NHK, Suzuki explained that the film is not to be expected anytime soon; Miyazaki in his younger age used to produce 10 minutes of animation every month, but now his speed was reduced to 1 minute per month. He contended that Miyazaki was unlikely to retire completely, as idleness would trouble him. Despite talk of Miyazaki's upcoming film being his last, Suzuki doubted it, asserting that as long as Miyazaki lives, he will likely keep making films.[33] Unlike his previous films, Miyazaki did not oversee every single frame and focused solely on creating the film's blueprint through storyboarding, while the animation director Takeshi Honda took charge of the animation process.[34] In March 2020, Suzuki disclosed that since the new film required a significant amount of time and money, the studio planned to finance the production by showcasing their previously released films on streaming platforms like Netflix. Miyazaki did not use a computer or smartphone and was unaware of online streaming, so Suzuki convinced him to make this deal to cover the costs, especially considering that their current project is unlike their previous endeavors.[35]

In May 2020, Suzuki recounted to Entertainment Weekly that the film was a ""big fantastical"" film. He said that 60 animators were working on the film and that an estimated 36 minutes had been completed after three years of production, saying ""we are still hand-drawing everything, but it takes us more time to complete a film because we're drawing more frames"", and they were ""hoping it will finish in the next three years"".[36] In December 2020, Suzuki stated that the production was working with no deadlines, similarly to The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (2013), which took eight years to make. He said that the animation was half-finished, that production was running faster due to COVID-19 restrictions requiring them to work at home, and that the film would be 125 minutes long.[37] He also revealed that Miyazaki wanted to adapt Earwig and the Witch (2020) during development, but his son Goro, an executive-producer of Kimitachi wa Dō Ikiru ka alongside Koji Hoshino and Kiyofumi Nakajima,[11] directed the adaptation instead.[38] Cinematographer Atsushi Okui introduced the idea of utilizing Dolby Cinema to Miyazaki during the production of Earwig and the Witch, which received the director's approval. Okui was particularly drawn to the technology's ability to maintain image sharpness in bright scenes while preventing dark areas from becoming overly black.[39][40] In October 2021, the director conveyed to T that he was making the film because he didn't have an answer [to the question Kimitachi wa Dō Ikiru ka], while the producer characterized the forthcoming release as an ambitious fantasy project.[41] In October 2022, Hoshino mentioned during a press conference that the production of the film had progressed quite smoothly, even during the pandemic, and was nearing completion. Hoshino did not specify the exact release date for the film but added that it would ""indeed be Miyazaki's final film"".[42] In December 2022, Takuya Kimura, who voiced Howl in Howl's Moving Castle, ""hinted"" that he was in the film with a post on social media.[43] Suzuki considered The Boy and the Heron to be the most expensive film ever produced in Japan.[44] The production timeline spanned approximately seven years, comprising two and a half years dedicated to pre-production activities and about five years for the production phase.[45] In June 2023, Suzuki clarified that the novel is not related to the film beyond inspiring the title.[46][47]

GKIDS managed casting for the English version in collaboration with Studio Ghibli, adhering to the SAG-AFTRA Foreign Dubbing Agreement during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. The dub was directed by Michael Sinterniklaas at NYAV Post, and Stephanie Sheh wrote the English script.[48] The English cast, unveiled on October 17, features Christian Bale, Dave Bautista, Gemma Chan, Willem Dafoe, Karen Fukuhara, Mark Hamill, Robert Pattinson and Florence Pugh.[3]

Music
Main article: The Boy and the Heron (soundtrack)
The film score was composed by Miyazaki's longtime collaborator Joe Hisaishi.[49] The soundtrack, consisting of 37 songs, was released in Japan on August 9, 2023, by Tokuma Japan Communications.[50][51] Kenshi Yonezu was in charge of the theme song, titled ""Chikyūgi"" (地球儀, lit. ""Globe"") in Japan,[49][52] and titled ""Spinning Globe"" internationally.[53] Yonezu's first visit to Studio Ghibli in 2018 led to his collaboration with Miyazaki, driven by his composition of ""Paprika"" for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Suzuki witnessed Miyazaki singing the song with children at Ghibli's nursery school, and the director approved the composition after reviewing a demo recording. Yonezu, shown storyboards and provided with project details, engaged in a five-year creative process with Miyazaki and Suzuki, resulting in the completion of the musical composition.[54]

Release
On December 13, 2022, Toho declared that The Boy and the Heron has a scheduled theatrical release date of July 14, 2023 in Japan.[55][56][57]

The film was released in Japan without any traditional marketing campaign, with no trailers nor promotional stills of the film released before its premiere with the exception of a single poster. The decision to do so came from Suzuki, who opted to eschew traditional marketing methods due to concerns about over-revealing film content, in response to what he believed to be a fundamental preference among moviegoers for a more enigmatic cinematic experience.[58][59] The cast and crew were kept largely undisclosed until the release date.[60] After the preview screening held in late February 2023, where strict confidentiality measures were in place, a message from Miyazaki was read out following the end credits, saying ""Perhaps you didn't understand it. I myself don't understand it.""[10][4] On June 29, 2023, during the opening day of Friday Road Show [ja] and Ghibli Exhibition Tokyo 2023,[61] Suzuki publicly spoke on how Miyazaki is ""worried"" over the lack of publicity for the film, but said that he trusts the work behind it and believes it is best for the film.[62][63] It is the first Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki film to have a simultaneous release on IMAX, as well as other high-end formats like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Cinema, and DTS:X.[64][65][66]

The film was pre-sold overseas with no concrete release date.[46] Goodfellas, formerly known as Wild Bunch International, served as the sales agent for the film's distribution.[67] Upon the film's release in Japan, the North American rights were acquired by distributor GKIDS, making it the widest film release in the company's 15-year history.[6] Internationally titled The Boy and the Heron, it was screened in special previews on November 22 ahead of its theatrical United States release on December 8, 2023.[68][69][70] The first photos from the film were published in the theater pamphlets distributed by Ghibli on August 11.[71][72][73] The film had its international premiere at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival as its opening film on September 7, becoming the first animated film in history to open the festival[74][75] and the festival's ""strongest opening night film in decades"".[76] The film was also shown at the 71st San Sebastián International Film Festival, the 2023 New York Film Festival, the 56th Sitges Film Festival and the 42nd Vancouver International Film Festival.[77][78][79][80]

Studio Ghibli granted promotional control to GKIDS for the American release, leading GKIDS to adapt a new marketing strategy, including the release of a teaser trailer on September 6[81] in advance of the film's international premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, to reach a wider audience while preserving Ghibli's branding and integrity.[6] At the international premiere, where the director Guillermo del Toro introduced the film at its gala presentation,[c][82] Studio Ghibli's Vice President Junichi Nishioka said that, contrary to rumors of retirement, Ghibli did not consider The Boy and the Heron to be Miyazaki's final film, and that Miyazaki is developing ideas for a new film and maintains a daily presence at his office, dispelling any notions of retirement. He said that Studio Ghibli did not envisage this film as a contender in award competitions and rejects the notion of associating films with wins or losses, and that Miyazaki's primary aim is for the audience to watch and enjoy the film.[6][83] Suzuki reiterated Nishioka's statement about Miyazaki's next project in October 2023, saying that Miyazaki has already moved on from The Boy and the Heron and is thinking about his new film every day.[84] Later in the same month, the official guidebook for the film was released, showing behind-the-scenes featurettes such as interviews, roundtable discussions and storyboards.[85]

In Japan, The Boy and the Heron grossed US$13.2 million (¥1.8 billion) in its opening weekend, becoming Studio Ghibli's biggest opening and surpassing Howl's Moving Castle's ¥1.5 billion debut in 2004. The film earned US$1.7 million from 44 IMAX screens, setting a new 3-day record.[87] It attracted 1.35 million viewers and exceeded ¥2.1 billion (US$15.2 million) in box office revenue in its first four days.[88] On September 11, the film became the 20th highest-grossing anime in Japan.[101] It dropped out of the top 10 grossing films for the first time in its thirteenth weekend.[102] The gross amount increased by about one to three hundred thousand yen each week, from ¥8.44 billion on October 15 to ¥8.66 billion on December 24.[103]

Film journalist Hiroo Ōtaka noted the industry's astonishment at the rapid box office success for the film's unconventional ""minimalist promotion"" strategy. The achievement has evoked mixed feelings among industry insiders, with distribution representatives expressing concerns to Ōtaka, fearing the challenge of this no-promotion strategy on their livelihoods and the necessity of traditional advertising methods. In addition to this marketing strategy, Ōtaka identified two important aspects of the film's commercial success. The first is that the deliberate approach of leaving the film by itself capitalized on its existing fan base by generating discussion and interaction on social media. He also mentioned Ghibli's earlier works, regularly featured on Friday Road Show for a decade, indirectly promoted the film.[104]

As of January 21, 2024, the film had grossed an additional US$98.3 million worldwide, bringing its total gross to US$159.6 million.[2][1] It became the first original anime film and Miyazaki's first film to reach number one at the box office in Canada and the United States, opening with US$5.2 million and grossing US$12.8 million over its first weekend.[105]

Critical response
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 236 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads: ""Soulfully exploring thought-provoking themes through a beautifully animated lens, The Boy and the Heron is another Miyazaki masterpiece.""[106] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 based on 54 critic reviews, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[107] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the English-dubbed version of the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.[108]

Although initial reactions to the film were described as ""mixed"",[d] with reviewers finding it abundantly detailed and laden with meaning,[e] the film quickly garnered critical acclaim in Japan.[f] Film site Eiga Channel praised the film as one of Ghibli's finest in terms of visuals and storytelling, but pointed out that non-Ghibli enthusiasts might find the rapid scene transitions confusing.[121] Film and culture magazine Cinemas+ observed that the film draws on motifs and characters from throughout Miyazaki's career, embedding them in a narrative that is somewhat darker, more complex, and more personal than many of his works.[122] Similarly, Time Out Japan hailed the film as ""a mature, complex masterpiece, weaving together the director's past, present, and future – a beautiful enigma that promises to be worth the wait.""[111] Cezary Jan Strusiewicz from Polygon found the fantasy elements to be ""absolutely beautiful, and they naturally include shots of the classic impossibly delicious-looking Ghibli food"", and wrote that people ""can watch this movie over and over, always finding something new and exciting in it"". He stated that there is a nostalgic longing for the past that evokes the impression of a director reflecting on their career before stepping away, and this underlines ""the makings of a perfect swan song"".[123] In his review for The Japan Times, Matt Schley awarded the film a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, expressing that while its position within his list of favorite Miyazaki works remains uncertain, there were moments that left him breathless.[7] While acknowledging the film's complexity and potential to not resonate with all viewers, Full Frontal author Matteo Watzky regarded these qualities as its best aspects, showcasing Miyazaki's talent, subtlety, and imagination.[112]

First international reviews were ""unanimously positive"".[124] Caryn James of the BBC, who rated it 5 out of 5 stars, felt the film is the culmination of Miyazaki's career and therefore may require multiple viewings to fully absorb the narrative's unwavering pace and the rich tapestry of imagery. She opined that the film presents a narrative blending wartime tragedy and supernatural exploration through the character Mahito, characterized by Miyazaki's meticulous attention to detail, a vibrant palette, and the seamless interplay between reality and the otherworldly, with characters assuming dreamlike forms that exemplify Miyazaki's innovative storytelling and visual prowess.[125] Tomris Laffly, writing for TheWrap, epitomized the film as a ""swan song so personal, artful and ultimately timeless"" and thought it was ""the deepest and darkest Studio Ghibli film"" since Grave of the Fireflies.[126] David Ehrlich of IndieWire, who gave the film an ""A"" rating, wrote that the film ""finds Miyazaki so nakedly bidding adieu — to us, and to the crumbling kingdom of dreams and madness that he'll soon leave behind — that it somehow resolves into an even more fitting goodbye [than The Wind Rises], one graced with the divine awe and heart-stopping wistfulness of watching a true immortal make peace with their own death.""[127] IGN's Rafael Motamayor reviewed The Boy and the Heron as Ghibli's ""most visually complex film"" and awarded it a score of 9 out of 10, where he expressed how Miyazaki has delivered an exceptional conclusion to his distinguished career through a ""stunning animated adventure"" that reminds audiences of their fortune to witness Studio Ghibli's cinematic creations.[128] On a less positive side, The Guardian writer Radheyan Simonpillai, assigning the film 3 out of 5 stars, saw it as ""a gentler and slower though no less soulful addition to his canon.""[129]

The Wind Rises (Japanese: 風立ちぬ, Hepburn: Kaze Tachinu, lit. 'The Wind Has Risen') is a 2013 Japanese animated historical drama film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, animated by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI. It was released in Japan on 20 July 2013 by Toho, and in North America by Touchstone Pictures on 21 February 2014.

The Wind Rises is a fictionalised biographical film of Jiro Horikoshi (1903–1982), designer of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter aircraft and its successor, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, used by the Empire of Japan during World War II. The film was adapted from Miyazaki's manga of the same name.

The Wind Rises was the highest-grossing Japanese film in Japan in 2013. Though it caused some political controversy and criticism in Asia, it was met with critical acclaim. The film was nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year, winning the latter.

Plot

Mitsubishi aircraft manufacturing factory, Nagoya

Mampei Hotel, Karuizawa
In 1916, a young Jiro Horikoshi longs to become a pilot, but his nearsightedness prevents it. One night, he dreams of his idol, the Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni, who tells him that he has never flown a plane in his life, and that building planes is better than flying them. Seven years later after World War I ended, Jiro is traveling by train to study aeronautical engineering at Tokyo Imperial University and meets a young girl, Nahoko Satomi, traveling with her maid. When the Great Kantō earthquake hits, Nahoko's maid's leg is broken and Jiro helps Nahoko carry her to Nahoko's family home, leaving without giving his name.

In 1925, Jiro graduates with his friend Kiro Honjo and both are employed at aircraft manufacturer Mitsubishi, assigned to design a fighter plane, the Mitsubishi 1MF9, for the Imperial Army. During a test, it breaks apart in midair and is rejected. Dispirited about what he perceives as the backwardness of Japanese aircraft technology, Jiro is sent with Honjo to the Weimar Republic in 1929 to carry out technical research and obtain a production license for a Junkers G.38 aircraft. Jiro dreams again of Caproni, who tells him that the world is better for the beauty of planes, even if humankind might put them to terrible purposes.

In early 1932, Jiro is promoted to chief designer for a fighter plane competition sponsored by the Imperial Navy, but his design, the Mitsubishi 1MF10, fails testing in 1933 and is rejected. Disappointed, he goes to a summer resort in Karuizawa to rest, where he meets Nahoko again. Hans Castorp, a German visitor privately critical of the Nazi regime, tells Jiro, who intends to visit Dessau, that Hugo Junkers is in trouble for fighting Nazism and that Germany will go to war again and must be stopped.

Later, Jiro asks Nahoko's father for his blessing to marry her, and the two are engaged. However, Nahoko has tuberculosis and wants to wait until she recovers to marry. Castorp assists in the romance before fleeing arrest by the Japanese secret police. Wanted in connection with Castorp, Jiro hides at his supervisor's home while he works on a new fighter aircraft project for the Imperial Navy. Following a lung hemorrhage, Nahoko recovers in a mountain sanatorium but cannot bear being apart from Jiro and returns to marry him. Jiro's sister Kayo, a doctor, warns Jiro that his marriage to Nahoko will end tragically as tuberculosis is incurable. Though Nahoko's health deteriorates, she and Jiro enjoy their time together.

Jiro leaves for the test flight of his new prototype aircraft, the Mitsubishi A5M. Knowing that she will die soon, Nahoko returns to the sanatorium, leaving farewell letters for Jiro, her family, and friends. At the test site, Jiro is distracted from his success by a gust of wind, suggesting Nahoko's passing. In 1945, after Japan lost World War II, Jiro dreams of Caproni again, regretting that his aircraft was used for war. Caproni comforts him, saying that Jiro's dream of building beautiful aircraft was nonetheless realized. Nahoko appears, encouraging her husband to live his life to the fullest. Jiro and Caproni walk together into their shared kingdom of dreams.

Development
The film's title comes from the poetic line:
""Le vent se lève!... Il faut tenter de vivre! (""The wind rises!... We must try to live!"")"" ' — Paul Valéry, ""Le Cimetière Marin"" (The Graveyard by the Sea).[8][9]

The Wind Rises was directed by Hayao Miyazaki, whose previous films include My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.[10] It was his first feature film since Ponyo in 2008.[11]

Miyazaki began to conceive a story to illustrate the life of Jiro Horikoshi in 2008.[12] He published the story as a manga series in the monthly magazine Model Graphix from April 2009 to January 2010, with the title being an allusion to Paul Valéry's 1920 poem ""Le Cimetière Marin"" (The Graveyard by the Sea).[13] The film also references Tatsuo Hori's 1937 semi-autobiographical novel The Wind Has Risen (風立ちぬ?),[14] and uses visuals to depict Hori's words.[12] The manga portrayed certain characters as anthropomorphized pigs, employing a design reminiscent of that seen in Miyazaki's film Porco Rosso (1992).[15]

The story in the manga follows the historical account of Horikoshi's aircraft development up to 1935 (the year of the Mitsubishi A5M's maiden flight),[16] and intertwines with fictional encounters with Caproni and Nahoko Satomi (里見菜穂子?).[17] The scenes with Nahoko in the manga included elements from the novel The Wind Has Risen,[12] in which Tatsuo Hori wrote about his life experience with his fiancée, Ayako Yano (矢野綾子?), before she died from tuberculosis. The name Nahoko Satomi was created from the female protagonist of another novel by Tatsuo Hori, Nahoko (菜穂子?).[18]

Characters frequently discuss Thomas Mann's novel The Magic Mountain, and, in a letter to Nahoko, Jiro names his fleeing German friend ""Mr. Castorp"" after its protagonist.[19][20] The character himself is a caricature of Stephen Alpert, who was once the executive director of Ghibli's international division. He left the company in 2011 for personal reasons, but was instrumental in Ghibli's overseas expansion. He was asked to return to Japan to model for the character's appearance and a suitable voice.[21]

After the release of Ponyo, Miyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea II, but producer Toshio Suzuki proposed to adopt the manga The Wind Has Risen instead. At first, Miyazaki rejected the proposal because he created the manga as a hobby and considered its subjects not suitable for children, the traditional audience of Studio Ghibli's features. However, he changed his mind when a staff member suggested that ""children should be allowed to be exposed to subjects they are not familiar with"".[22] He was also inspired to make the film after reading a quote from Horikoshi: ""All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful"".[23]

Music
The film's score was composed and conducted by Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra.

The film also includes singer-songwriter Yumi Matsutoya's 1973 song ""Hikō-ki Gumo"" (ひこうき雲). Matsutoya had collaborated with Studio Ghibli on Kiki's Delivery Service, which features her songs Rouge no Dengon (ルージュの伝言) and Yasashisa ni Tsutsumaretanara (やさしさに包まれたなら). Producer Suzuki recommended ""Hikōki-gumo"" to Miyazaki in December 2012, feeling the lyrics resembled the story of The Wind Rises.[24]

The film's soundtrack was released in Japan on 17 July 2013 by Tokuma Japan Communications.[25]

""Das gibt's nur einmal"" (English: It only happens once) is the German song Hans Castorp sings while playing the piano at Hotel Kusakaru in the film.[13]

Release
The Wind Rises was to have been released simultaneously with The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, another Ghibli film by Isao Takahata, in Japan in mid-2013.[11] It would have been the first time the two directors' works were released together since the release of My Neighbor Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies in 1988.[11] However, Princess Kaguya was delayed until 23 November 2013,[26] and The Wind Rises was released on 20 July 2013.[23]

The film played in competition at the 70th Venice International Film Festival.[27][28] It had its official North American premiere at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival,[29] although a sneak preview was presented earlier at the 2013 Telluride Film Festival, outside of the official program.[30]

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributed the film in North America through its Touchstone Pictures banner.[31][32] English dubbing was directed by Gary Rydstrom.[33] Disney held a one-week release window in the Los Angeles theatrical circuit beginning on 8 November 2013, so that it could qualify for Academy Awards consideration.[34] It was released theatrically on 21 February 2014 in select cities, with wide release on 28 February.[35] It was released in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2014 by StudioCanal.[36]

Home media
Walt Disney Studios Japan released the movie on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in Japan on 18 June 2014.[37] The Japanese DVD release sold 128,784 units until 7 December 2014[38] and a further 6,735 units between 8 December 2014 and 7 June 2015,[39] for a combined 141,245 DVD units as of 7 June 2015.

In the United States, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on 18 November 2014. The release includes supplement features with storyboards, the original Japanese trailers and TV spots, a ""Behind the Microphone"" featurette with members of the English voice cast, and a video from when the film was announced to be completed. The audio for both English and Japanese language is monophonic (DTS-HD MA 1.0).[40] Even though the North American rights Disney owned on Studio Ghibli films expired in 2017, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment continued to distribute The Wind Rises until 2020, when GKIDS re-released it on DVD and Blu-ray on 22 September 2020 with distribution through Shout! Factory.[41] The re-release took longer than with other Studio Ghibli titles as it was still a fairly new film, and Disney still held the US rights.[citation needed]

The film has grossed over $9 million from physical DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US as of April 2022.[42] In the United Kingdom, it was 2015's fifth best-selling foreign-language film on home video, and third best-selling Asian film (below The Raid 2 and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya).[43]

Reception
Box office
The film grossed ¥11.6 billion (US$113 million)[44] at the Japanese box office, the highest-grossing film in Japan in 2013.[45]

Critical response
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes sampled 180 reviews, and judged 88% of them positive, giving the film a ""Certified Fresh"" rating, with an average score of 8/10. The consensus states: ""The Wind Rises is a fittingly bittersweet swan song for director Hayao Miyazaki"".[46] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, rated the film an 83/100 based on 41 reviews, citing ""universal acclaim"".[47]

Critic David Ehrlich rated the film 9.7/10 and called it ""perhaps the greatest animated film ever made."" He wrote: ""While initially jarring, Miyazaki's unapologetic deviations from fact help The Wind Rises to transcend the linearity of its expected structure, the film eventually revealing itself to be less of a biopic than it is a devastatingly honest lament for the corruption of beauty, and how invariably pathetic the human response to that loss must be. Miyazaki’s films are often preoccupied with absence, the value of things left behind and how the ghosts of beautiful things are traced onto our memories like the shadows of objects outlined by a nuclear flash. The Wind Rises looks back as only a culminating work can.""[48] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called the film ""visually exquisite and emotionally charged"".[49] Film critic Mark Kermode called it ""a rich treat for the eye and soul alike."".[50]

The Japan Times gave the film 3 1⁄2 stars out of 5, and stated: ""A visually sumptuous celebration of an unspoiled prewar Japan.""[51] In a review for The Asia-Pacific Journal, Matthew Penney wrote: ""What Miyazaki offers is a layered look at how Horikoshi's passion for flight was captured by capital and militarism""; and that it was ""one of Miyazaki's most ambitious and thought-provoking visions as well as one of his most beautifully realized visual projects"".[52]

Controversy
In Japan, The Wind Rises received criticism from both the Japanese political right[23] and from the Japan Society for Tobacco Control.[53] Miyazaki added to the controversy by publishing an essay in which he criticized the proposal by Japan's right-wing Liberal Democratic Party to change Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution to allow Japan to remilitarize.[23][53][54]

Miyazaki also attracted political criticism from Korean internet users, who argued that the Zero represents Japanese military aggression and that many planes were assembled by Korean forced labour.[53] In response, Miyazaki noted to Korean journalists that ""[Horikoshi] was someone who resisted demands from the military...I wonder if he should be liable for anything just because he lived in that period.""[53] In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun, Miyazaki said he had ""very complex feelings"" about World War II since, as a pacifist, he felt militarist Japan had acted out of ""foolish arrogance"". However, he also said that the Zero plane ""represented one of the few things we Japanese could be proud of—[they] were a truly formidable presence, and so were the pilots who flew them"".[53]

Accolades

Mississippi Burning is a 1988 American crime thriller film directed by Alan Parker that is loosely based on the 1964 murder investigation of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in Mississippi. It stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as two FBI agents investigating the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi, who are met with hostility by the town's residents, local police, and the Ku Klux Klan.

Screenwriter Chris Gerolmo began the script in 1986 after researching the 1964 murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. He and producer Frederick Zollo presented it to Orion Pictures, and the studio hired Parker to direct the film. The writer and director had disputes over the script, and Orion allowed Parker to make uncredited rewrites. The film was shot in a number of locations in Mississippi and Alabama, with principal photography from March to May 1988.

On release, Mississippi Burning was criticized by activists involved in the civil rights movement and the families of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner for its fictionalization of events. Critical reaction was generally positive, with praise aimed towards the cinematography and the performances of Hackman, Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The film grossed $34.6 million in North America against a production budget of $15 million. It received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and won for Best Cinematography.

Plot
In 1964, three civil rights workers – two Jewish and one black – go missing while in Jessup County, Mississippi, organizing a voter registry for African Americans. The FBI sends Alan Ward and Rupert Anderson to investigate. Ward is a Northerner, senior in rank but much younger than Anderson, and approaches the investigation by the book. In contrast, Anderson, a former Mississippi sheriff, is more nuanced in his approach. The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies influence the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered and their bodies buried in an earthen dam. Pell beats his wife brutally in retribution after discovering her betrayal.

Ward and Anderson's different approaches spill over into a physical fight which Ward wins but concedes his methods have been ineffective and gives Anderson carte blanche to deal with the problem his way. Anderson devises a plan to indict members of the Klan for civil rights violations, instead of murder, as civil rights are federal charges where conviction is more certain compared to a state-level charge of murder. The FBI arranges a kidnapping of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack, where he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he speaks out. Tilman gives him a complete description of the killings, including the names of those involved. The abductor is revealed to be an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman. Although the obtained information is inadmissible in court due to coercion, it does prove valuable to the investigators.

Anderson and Ward concoct a plan, luring identified Klan collaborators to a bogus meeting, but the men soon realize they have been set up and leave without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrates on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest who exhibits a nervous demeanor, which the agents believe might yield a confession. The Feds pick him up and interrogate him. Anderson stages a tussle with Pell at the local barbershop in retaliation for the attack on his wife and takes off. Later, Cowens is at home when a shotgun blast shatters his windows. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, he attempts to flee in his truck but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The team arrives to rescue him, having staged the entire scene where the hooded men are revealed to be other FBI agents.

Cowens, believing that his redneck brothers have threatened his life because of his admissions to the FBI, finally incriminates his accomplices. The Klansmen are all charged with civil rights violations, as this can be prosecuted at the federal level (murder was a state-based charge in 1964). Most of the perpetrators are convicted, while Stuckey is acquitted of all charges. The FBI later finds Tilman has hanged himself, and Bird wonders why. Ward tells him Tilman was guilty -- for being a witness. Mrs. Pell returns to her home, which has been completely ransacked by vandals. She resolves to stay and rebuild her life, free of her husband. Before leaving town, Anderson and Ward visit an integrated congregation, gathered at an African-American cemetery, where the black civil rights activist's desecrated gravestone reads, ""Not Forgotten.""

Historical context
Main articles: Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner and United States v. Price

Missing persons poster created by the FBI in 1964, showing the photographs of civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.
On June 21, 1964, civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were arrested in Philadelphia, Mississippi, by Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price, and taken to a Neshoba County jail.[2] The three men worked on the ""Freedom Summer"" campaign, attempting to organize a voter registry for African Americans.[3] Price charged Chaney with speeding and held the other two men for questioning.[2] He released the three men on bail seven hours later and followed them out of town.[4][5] After Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner failed to return to Meridian, Mississippi, on time, workers for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) placed calls to the Neshoba County jail, asking if the police had any information on their whereabouts.[6] Two days later, FBI agent John Proctor and ten other agents began their investigation in Neshoba County. They received a tip about a burning CORE station wagon seen in the woods off Highway 21, about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. The investigation was given the code name ""MIBURN"" (short for ""Mississippi Burning""),[7][8] and top FBI inspectors were sent to help with the case.[2]

On August 4, 1964, the bodies of the three men were found after an informant nicknamed ""Mr. X"" in FBI reports passed along a tip to federal authorities.[5][9] They were discovered underneath an earthen dam on a 253-acre farm located a few miles outside Philadelphia, Mississippi.[10] All three men were shot.[4] Nineteen suspects were the subject of a federal indictment for violating the workers' civil rights.[5] On October 27, 1967, a federal trial conducted in Meridian resulted in only seven of the defendants, including Price, being convicted with sentences ranging from three to ten years. Nine were acquitted, and the jury deadlocked on three others.[4]

Subsequent events
In 2002, Jerry Mitchell, an investigative reporter for The Clarion-Ledger, discovered new evidence regarding the murders. He also located new witnesses and pressured the state of Mississippi to reopen the case.[11] Stevenson High School teacher Barry Bradford and three of his students aided Mitchell in his investigation after the three students chose to research the ""Mississippi Burning"" case for a history project.[12]

The identity of Mr. X was a closely held secret for 40 years.[13] In the process of reopening the case, Mitchell, Bradford and the three students discovered the informant's identity. Mr. X was revealed to be Maynard King, a highway patrolman who revealed the location of the civil rights workers' bodies to FBI Agent Joseph Sullivan.[14] In 2005, one perpetrator, Edgar Ray Killen, was charged for his part in the crimes. He was convicted of three counts of manslaughter, and received a 60-year sentence.[5][15] Killen died in prison on January 11, 2018.[16]

Production
Development
In 1985, screenwriter Chris Gerolmo discovered an article that excerpted a chapter from the book Inside Hoover's F.B.I., which chronicled the FBI's investigation into the murders of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner.[17] While writing a draft script, Gerolmo brought it to producer Frederick Zollo, who worked with him on Miles from Home (1988).[18] Zollo helped Gerolmo develop the original draft before they sold it to Orion Pictures.[19]

The studio then began its search for a director. Filmmakers Miloš Forman and John Schlesinger were among those considered to helm the project.[18] In September 1987, Alan Parker was given a copy of Gerolmo's script by Orion's executive vice president and co-founder Mike Medavoy.[19] When Parker traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to act as a juror for the 1987 Tokyo International Film Festival, his colleague Robert F. Colesberry began researching the time period, and compiled books, newspaper articles, live news footage and photographs related to the 1964 murders.[20][21] Upon returning to the United States, Parker met with Colesberry in New York and spent several months viewing the research.[19][21] The director also began selecting the creative team; the production reunited Parker with many of his past collaborators, including Colesberry, casting directors Howard Feuer and Juliet Taylor, director of photography Peter Biziou, editor Gerry Hambling, costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard, production designer Geoffrey Kirkland, camera operator Michael Roberts, and music composer Trevor Jones.[19][22]

Writing
Gerolmo described his original draft script as ""a big, passionate, violent detective story set against the greatest sea-change in American life in the 20th century, the civil rights movement"".[17] For legal reasons, the names of the people and certain details related to the FBI's investigation were changed.[7] On presenting Clinton Pell's wife as an informant, Gerolmo said, ""... the fact that no one knew who Mr. X, the informant, was, left that as a dramatic possibility for me, in my Hollywood movie version of the story. That's why Mr. X became the wife of one of the conspirators.""[7] The abductor of Mayor Tilman was originally written as a Mafia hitman who forces a confession by putting a pistol in Tilman's mouth. Gerolmo was inspired by Gregory Scarpa, a mob enforcer allegedly recruited by the FBI during their search for Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner.[23]

After Parker was hired to direct the film, Gerolmo had completed two drafts.[19] Parker met with Gerolmo at Orion's offices in Century City, Los Angeles, where they began work on a third draft script. Both the writer and director, however, had repeated disagreements over the focus of the story. To resolve the issue, Orion executives in New York gave Parker one month to make uncredited rewrites before green-lighting the project.[19]

Parker made several changes from Gerolmo's original draft. He omitted the Mafia hitman and created the character Agent Monk, a black FBI specialist who kidnaps Tilman.[7] The scene in which Frank Bailey brutally beats a news cameraman was based on an actual event; Parker and Colesberry were inspired by a news outtake found during their research, in which a CBS News cameraman was assaulted by a suspect in the 1964 murder case.[18] Parker also wrote a sex scene involving Rupert Anderson and Mrs. Pell. The scene was omitted during filming after Gene Hackman, who portrays Anderson, suggested to Parker that the relationship between the two characters be more discreet.[18][24] By January 4, 1988, Parker had written a complete shooting script, which he submitted to Orion executives.[19] Gerolmo did not visit the production during principal photography, due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.[20]

Casting


Top to bottom: Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, who star in the film.
Parker held casting calls in New York, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Orlando, New Orleans, Raleigh and Nashville.[19] The filmmakers did not retain the names of actual people; many of the supporting characters were composites of people related to the murder case.[7] Gene Hackman plays Rupert Anderson, an FBI agent and former Mississippi sheriff.[20] Brian Dennehy was briefly considered for the role[25] before Orion suggested Hackman.[20] As the script was being written, Parker frequently discussed the project with Hackman.[19] Hackman said that ""it felt right to do something of historical import. It was an extremely intense experience, both the content of the film and the making of it in Mississippi.""[24]

Orion was less resolute in terms of who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward,[20] and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter.[19] To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case.[26] Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said: ""Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research. All I did was listen to [Hackman]. He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). But the minute we got on the set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up and everything was available. It was mesmerizing. He's really believable, and it was like a basic acting lesson.""[27]

Gailard Sartain plays Ray Stuckey, the sheriff of Jessup County – a character based on former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey.[20][28] Sartain described Stuckey as ""an elected official ... who has to be gregarious – but with sinister overtones"".[29] Stephen Tobolowsky plays Clayton Townley, a Grand Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.[20] The character is based on White Knights leader Samuel Bowers.[30] Michael Rooker plays Frank Bailey, a Klansman involved in the murders of the three civil rights activists.[31] Pruitt Taylor Vince, who had a small role in Parker's previous film Angel Heart, plays Lester Cowens, a Klansman who unknowingly becomes a pawn in the FBI's investigation. Vince described the character as ""goofy, stupid and geeky"" and stated, ""I never had a prejudiced bone in my body. It gave me a funny feeling to play this guy with a hood and everything. But when you're in the midst of it, you just concentrate on getting through it.""[32]

Kevin Dunn joined the production in February 1988, appearing in his acting debut as FBI Agent Bird.[33] Tobin Bell, also making his feature film debut, plays Agent Stokes,[34] an FBI enforcer hired by Anderson to interrogate Cowens.[20] Bell was first asked by Parker to read for the role of Clinton Pell, a role that was ultimately given to Brad Dourif.[35]

Appearing as the three civil rights activists are Geoffrey Nauffts as ""Goatee"", a character based on Michael Schwerner; Rick Zieff as ""Passenger"", based on Andrew Goodman; and Christopher White as ""Black Passenger"", based on James Chaney.[20][22] Producers Frederick Zollo and Robert F. Colesberry also make appearances in the film; Zollo briefly appears as a news reporter,[22] and Colesberry appears as a news cameraman who is brutally beaten by Frank Bailey.[19] While scouting locations in Jackson, Mississippi, Parker arranged an open casting call for local actors and extras.[19] He and Colesberry met music teacher Lannie McBride, who appears as a gospel singer in the film.[19]

Filming
Location scouting
During the screenwriting process, Parker and Colesberry began scouting locations. They visited eight states based on suggestions made by the location department. The shooting script required that a total of 62 locations be used for filming.[19] In December 1987, Parker and Colesberry traveled to Mississippi to visit the stretch of road where Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were murdered.[20] The filmmakers were initially reluctant about filming in Mississippi; they expressed interest in filming in Forsyth County, Georgia, before being persuaded by John Horne, head of Mississippi's film commission.[18] Parker also met with Mississippi governor Ray Mabus, who voiced his support of the film's production.[19]

Parker and Colesberry looked at locations near Jackson, Mississippi, where they set up production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel.[19] They also visited Canton, Mississippi, before travelling to Vaiden, Mississippi, where they scouted more than 200 courthouses that could be used for filming.[19] Parker and Colesberry had difficulty finding a small town for the story setting before choosing LaFayette, Alabama, to act as scenes set in the fictional town of Jessup County, Mississippi, with other scenes being shot in a number of locales in Mississippi.[19]

Principal photography began on March 7, 1988,[19] with a budget of $15 million.[18][21][36] Filming began in Jackson, Mississippi, where the production team filmed a church being burned down. The sequence required a multiple-camera setup; a total of three cameras were used during the shoot.[19] On March 8, the production team filmed a scene set in a motel where Anderson (Hackman) delivers a monologue to Ward (Dafoe).[19] On March 10, production moved to a remote corner of Mississippi, where the crew filmed the burning of a parish church.[19]

On March 11, the production filmed scenes set in a pig farm, where a young boy is confronted and attacked by three perpetrators. A night later, the crew shot the film's opening sequence, in which the three civil rights workers are murdered.[19] From March 14 to March 18, the crew filmed the burning of several more churches, as well as scenes set in a farm.[19] On March 22, the crew filmed scenes set in a morgue that was located inside the University of Mississippi Medical Center, exactly the same location where the bodies of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were transported.[19] A day later, Parker and the crew filmed a scene set in a cotton field. The art department had to dress each plant with layers of cotton, as the cotton plants had not fully bloomed.[19] The crew also filmed the abduction of Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey) and his subsequent interrogation by FBI agent Monk (Badja Djola).[19] On March 24, the production moved to Raymond, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a scene at the John Bell Williams Airport.[19] Depicting Monk's departure, the scene was choreographed by Parker and the cast members so that it could be filmed in one take.[19]

The production then moved to Vaiden, Mississippi to film scenes set in the Carroll County Courthouse, where several courtroom scenes, as well as scenes set in Sheriff Ray Stuckey's office were filmed.[19][20] The production moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a funeral procession. On April 11, 1988, the crew filmed a scene set in the Cedar Hill Cemetery.[19] From April 15 to April 16, the production moved to the Mississippi River valley to depict the FBI and United States Navy's search for the three civil rights workers. The art department recreated a Choctaw Indian Village on the location, based on old photographs.[19] On April 23, the crew filmed a scene depicting a Citizens' Councils rally with 750 extras. On April 25, the crew returned to Jackson, Mississippi, where an unused building was to recreate a diner that was found in Alabama during location scouting. A day later, Hackman and Dafoe filmed their opening scene, in which the characters Anderson and Ward drive to Jessup County, Mississippi.[19]

On April 27, the production moved to LaFayette, Alabama, for the remainder of filming.[19] From April 28 to April 29, Parker and his crew filmed scenes set in Mrs. Pell's home. On May 5, the production shot one of the film's final scenes, in which Anderson discovers Mrs. Pell's home trashed. On May 13, the crew filmed scenes in a former LaFayette movie theatre. The art department restored the theatre's interiors to reflect the time period.[19] Filming concluded on May 14, 1988 with the Ku Klux Klan speech scene.[19]

Music
The score was produced, arranged and composed by Trevor Jones, his second collaboration with Parker after Angel Heart.[37] In addition to Jones's score, the soundtrack features several gospel songs, including ""Walk on by Faith"" performed by Lannie McBride, ""Take My Hand, Precious Lord"" performed by Mahalia Jackson and ""Try Jesus"" performed by Vesta Williams. A motion picture soundtrack album was released by the recording labels Antilles Records and Island Records.[38]

Release
Mississippi Burning held its world premiere at the Uptown Theatre in Washington, D.C., on December 2, 1988,[39] with various politicians, ambassadors and political reporters in attendance. United States Senator Ted Kennedy voiced his support of the film, stating, ""This movie will educate millions of Americans too young to recall the sad events of that summer about what life was like in this country before the enactment of the civil rights laws.""[39] The film was given a platform release, first being released in a small number of cities in North America before opening nationwide. It opened in Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto and New York City on December 9, 1988.[39][40] Orion was confident that the limited release would help qualify the film for Academy Awards consideration, and generate strong word-of-mouth support from audiences.[39][41] The film opened in wide release on January 27, 1989,[42] playing at 1,058 theaters, and expanding to 1,074 theatres by its ninth week.[43]

Box office
Mississippi Burning's first week of limited release saw it take $225,034, an average of $25,003.40 per theater.[43] The film grossed an additional $160,628 in its second weekend.[43] More theaters were added during the limited run, and on January 27, 1989, the film officially entered wide release. Over its first weekend of wide release, the film grossed $3,545,305, securing the number five position at the domestic box office with a domestic gross to date of $14,726,112.[43] The film generated strong local interest in the state of Mississippi, resulting in sold-out showings in the first four days of wide release.[44] After seven weeks of wide release, Mississippi Burning ended its theatrical run with an overall gross of $34,603,943.[43] In North America, it was the thirty-third highest-grossing film of 1988[45] and the seventeenth highest-grossing R-rated film of that year.[46]

Home media
Mississippi Burning was released on VHS on July 27, 1989, by Orion Home Video.[47] A ""Collector's Edition"" of the film was released on LaserDisc on April 3, 1998.[48] The film was released on DVD on May 8, 2001, by MGM Home Entertainment. Special features for the DVD include an audio commentary by Parker and a theatrical trailer.[49] The film was released on Blu-ray on May 12, 2015, by the home video label Twilight Time, with a limited release of 3,000 copies. The Blu-ray presents the film in 1080p high definition, and contains the additional materials found on the MGM DVD.[50] Kino Lorber reissued the film on Blu-ray on June 18, 2019, with a new 4K transfer and all the previously-available extras.[51]

Reception
Critical response

Frances McDormand received widespread acclaim for her performance as Mrs. Pell, which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 28 reviews, and gave Mississippi Burning a score of 79%, with an average score of 6.8/10. The consensus reads, ""Mississippi Burning draws on real-life tragedy to impart a worthy message with the measured control of an intelligent drama and the hard-hitting impact of a thriller.""[52] Another review aggregator, Metacritic, assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 11 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[53] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.[54]

In a review for Time magazine entitled ""Just Another Mississippi Whitewash"", author Jack E. White described the film as a ""cinematic lynching of the truth"".[55] Columnist Desson Howe of The Washington Post felt that the film ""speeds down the complicated, painful path of civil rights in search of a good thriller. Surprisingly, it finds it.""[56] Jonathan Rosenbaum lightly criticized Parker's direction, commenting that the film was ""sordid fantasy"" being ""trained on the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and the feast for the self-righteous that emerges has little to do with history, sociology, or even common sense.""[57] Rita Kempley, also writing for The Washington Post, criticized for viewing ""the black struggle from an all-white perspective"", and drew comparisons to Cry Freedom (1987), writing that both films had ""the right story, but with the wrong heroes.""[58] Pauline Kael, writing for The New Yorker, praised the acting, but described the film as being ""morally repugnant"".[59]

Vincent Canby of The New York Times praised the film's fictionalization of history, writing, ""The film doesn't pretend to be about the civil-rights workers themselves. It's almost as if Mr. Parker and Mr. Gerolmo respected the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them through the use of fiction.""[60] In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert surmised, ""We knew the outcome of this case when we walked into the theater. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964.""[61] On the syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a ""two thumbs up"" rating.[62] On his year-end top ten films list, Ebert ranked Mississippi Burning the #1 movie of 1988.[63] Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Siskel praised Hackman and Dafoe's ""subtle"" performances but felt that McDormand was ""most effective as the film's moral conscience"".[64]

Like Siskel, Variety magazine also praised the performances, writing, ""Dafoe gives a disciplined and noteworthy portrayal of Ward ... But it's Hackman who steals the picture as Anderson ... Glowing performance of Frances McDormand as the deputy's wife who's drawn to Hackman is an asset both to his role and the picture.""[65] Sheila Benson, in her review for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, ""Hackman's mastery at suggesting an infinite number of layers beneath a wry, self-deprecating surface reaches a peak here, but McDormand soars right with him. And since she is the film's sole voice of morality, it's right that she is so memorable.""[66]

Controversy
""... with Mississippi Burning the controversy got out of hand. It was impossible to turn on a TV without someone discussing the movie – or using the movie to trigger the debate ... In the beginning it was rather nice to have your film talked about but suddenly the tide turned and although it did well at the box office, we were dogged by a lot of anger that the film generated.""

—Parker reflecting on the film's controversy.[19]
Following its release, Mississippi Burning became embroiled in controversy over its fictionalization of events. Gerolmo and Parker have admitted taking artistic license with the source material describing it as essentially a ''work of fiction''. The killing itself, as portrayed in the film, differed from the actual events in several ways. In the film, during the car stop precipitating the murder, the driver is white (presumably either Andrew Goodman or Michael Schwerner), and the black civil rights volunteer (presumably James Chaney) is in the back seat. In reality, James Chaney drove the car because he was familiar with the area.[67] The film presents the murders as having been committed at the scene of the stop while the victims were in their car, beginning with Frank Bailey putting a revolver to the temple of the car's driver and shooting. In reality, all three victims were first taken to jail and were shot after their release. Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were shot once in the heart, followed by James Chaney who was shot three times.[67] Much of the violence and intimidation of the black people in the film is drawn from events that occurred at the time, although not necessarily in relation to this investigation. The title itself comes from the FBI code name for the investigation and some of the dialog is drawn directly from their files. A lot of the fictional elements surround the actions of the two main FBI agents.[7]

Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King Jr., boycotted the film, stating, ""How long will we have to wait before Hollywood finds the courage and the integrity to tell the stories of some of the many thousands of black men, women and children who put their lives on the line for equality?""[68] Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, said of the film, ""It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the movie could remember.""[69] Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stated that the film, in its fictionalization of historical events, ""reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud"" and portrays African Americans as ""cowed, submissive and blank-faced"".[70]

Carolyn Goodman, mother of Andrew Goodman, and Ben Chaney Jr., the younger brother of James Chaney, expressed that they were both ""disturbed"" by the film.[71] Goodman felt that it ""used the deaths of the boys as a means of solving the murders and the FBI being heroes.""[71] Chaney stated, ""... the image that younger people got (from the film) about the times, about Mississippi itself and about the people who participated in the movement being passive, was pretty negative and it didn't reflect the truth.""[71] Stephen Schwerner, brother of Michael Schwerner, felt that the film was ""terribly dishonest and very racist"" and ""[distorted] the realities of 1964"".[70]

On a Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 16, 1989) episode of ABC's late-night news program Nightline, Julian Bond, a social activist and leader in the Civil Rights Movement, nicknamed the film ""Rambo Meets the Klan""[72] and disapproved of its depiction of the FBI: ""People are going to have a mistaken idea about that time ... It's just wrong. These guys were tapping our telephones, not looking into the murders of [Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner].""[72] When asked about the film at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, filmmaker Spike Lee criticized the lack of central African-American characters, believing the film was among several others that used a white savior narrative to exploit blacks in favor of depicting whites as heroes.[73]

In response to these criticisms, Parker defended the film, stating that it was ""fiction in the same way that Platoon and Apocalypse Now are fictions of the Vietnam War. But the important thing is the heart of the truth, the spirit ... I defend the right to change it in order to reach an audience who knows nothing about the realities and certainly don't watch PBS documentaries.""[7]

Legal dispute
On February 21, 1989, former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey filed a lawsuit against Orion Pictures, claiming defamation and invasion of privacy. The lawsuit, filed at a United States district court in Meridian, Mississippi, asked for $8 million in damages.[28] Rainey, who was the county sheriff at the time of the 1964 murders, alleged that the filmmakers of Mississippi Burning portrayed him in an unfavorable light with the fictional character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain). ""Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is referring to me,"" he stated. ""What they said happened and what they did to me certainly wasn't right and something ought to be done about it.""[28] Rainey's lawsuit was unsuccessful; he dropped the suit after Orion's team of lawyers threatened to prove that the film was based on fact, and that Rainey was indeed suspected in the 1964 murders.[74]

Accolades
Mississippi Burning received various awards and nominations in categories ranging from recognition of the film itself to its writing, direction, editing, sound and cinematography, to the performances of Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand. It was named one of the ""Top 10 Films of 1988"" by the National Board of Review. The organization also awarded the film top honors at the 60th National Board of Review Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress.[75]

In January 1989, the film received four Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama (Hackman),[76] though it failed to win any of the awards at the 46th Golden Globe Awards.[77] In February 1989, Mississippi Burning was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor; its closest rivals were Rain Man leading with eight nominations, and Dangerous Liaisons, which also received seven nominations.[78] On March 29, 1989, at the 61st Academy Awards, the film won only one of the seven awards for which it was nominated, Best Cinematography.[79] At the 43rd British Academy Film Awards, the film received five nominations, ultimately winning for Best Sound, Best Cinematography and Best Editing.[80] In 2006, the film was nominated by the American Film Institute for its 100 Years ... 100 Cheers list.[81]

And interestingly beautiful. I could watch most any of his movies, just to look at the beautiful scenery. I love some of the incredible imagination that goes into his works.I could easily recommend this film. No, it's not the better than the rest, but I feel it's definitely worth your time.I look forward to seeing the film again, maybe I will understand some things a bit better.helpful•8743deegolaFeb 23, 2005Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inLovable Creatures: Our Favorite Screen PalsLovable Creatures: Our Favorite Screen PalsGrogu, E.T., and more cuddly creatures we love to see on the screen.See the galleryPhotosFAQ2Was Diana Wynne Jones involved?Why is he named ""Howl""?DetailsEditRelease dateAugust 18, 2005 (Netherlands)Country of originJapanOfficial siteDisney (United States)LanguageJapaneseAlso known asLâu Đài Di Động Của HowlProduction companiesBuena Vista Home EntertainmentDENTSU Music And EntertainmentMitsubishiSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$24,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$6,789,268Opening weekend US & Canada$427,987Jun 12, 2005Gross worldwide$237,543,524See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 59 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby Digital EXDTS-ESSDDSAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Storyline
Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.—aliw135

Trivia
When Forrest gets up to talk at the Vietnam rally in Washington, the microphone plug is pulled and you cannot hear him. According to Tom Hanks he said, ""Sometimes when people go to Vietnam, they go home to their mommas without any legs. Sometimes they don't go home at all. That's a bad thing. That's all I have to say about that.""
Goofs
When Forrest is given his discharge papers, he sets down his ping-pong paddle and (computerized) ball to salute the officer. When he picks the paddle back up, he also pretends to pick up the ball, which didn't end up getting animated.
Quotes
Forrest Gump: [running] I had run for 3 years, 2 months, 14 days, and 16 hours.

[he stops and turns around]

Young Man Running: Quiet, quiet! He's gonna say something!

Forrest Gump: [pause] I'm pretty tired... I think I'll go home now.

Alternate versions
In the TBS and the ABC version, the line at the end of the dorm scene is cut, ""I think I ruined your roommate's bath robe"".

Dropping My Keys

I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.

I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.

Forrest states the obvious, ""Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!""

And the water-works just started to flow.

I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, ""That's why I love you.""

Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen.

I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.

When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, ""Hey, Boo,"" the fob goes flying.

The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain.

I can't help it.

The flower is used in the tradition of Dia de los Muertos in México to guide the deceased to the living.GoofsThe dead are obviously stuck at the age that they died. Imelda and Hector have spent several years in the afterlife at the same time, and Imelda has never realized that Hector is the same age as he was when he left her, clearly indicating the reason he never came back. She still wouldn't have known that he intended to come back and could simply think that he died shortly after deserting his family.QuotesHéctor: [sings] Remember me, though I have to say goodbye / Remember me, don't let it make you cry / For even if I'm far away, I hold you in my heart / I sing a secret song to you, each night we are apart / Remember me, though I have to travel far / Remember me, each time you hear a sad guitar / Know that I'm with you, the only way that I can be / Until you're in my arms again, remember me...Crazy creditsAt the end of the closing credits, there is an ofrenda to the deceased people who inspired the filmmakers of Coco, in the form of a mosaic made from photographs.ConnectionsFeatured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Must See Trailers of June 2017 (2017)SoundtracksRemember MeMusic & Lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez & Robert LopezProduced by Germaine Franco, Kristen Anderson-Lopez & Robert LopezAs Performed by Ernesto de la Cruz - Benjamin BrattAs Performed by Héctor & Young Coco - Gael García Bernal, Gabriella Flores & Libertad García FonziAs Performed by Miguel & Mamá Coco - Anthony Gonzalez & Ana Ofelia MurguíaUser reviews1.3KReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 I cried twice watching this.I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.Though the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.Coco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll.helpful•48362pramsalimDec 2, 2017Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ1Any films similar to ""Coco""?DetailsEditRelease dateNovember 29, 2017 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesMexicoJapanOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial siteLanguagesEnglishSpanishAlso known asUntitled Dia de los Muertos ProjectFilming locationsPixar Animation Studios - 1200 Park Avenue, Emeryville, California, USAProduction companiesWalt Disney PicturesPixar Animation StudiosDía de MuertosSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$175,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$210,460,015Opening weekend US & Canada$50,802,605Nov 26, 2017Gross worldwide$814,337,054See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 45 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosAuro 11.1Dolby Surround 7.112-Track Digital SoundDolby DigitalSDDSAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Trivia
As preparation for his traumatic scene in the interrogation room, Leland Orser would breathe in and out rapidly, so that his body would be overly saturated with oxygen, giving him the ability to hyperventilate. He also did not sleep for a few days, in order to achieve his character's disoriented look.
Goofs
When the detectives are at the door of John Doe's apartment, John walks into the hallway. He sees them, drops his bag of groceries, pulls a gun, shoots, and runs. The bag is now on the floor, with its contents spilled out. When Mills gives chase, he runs down the same hallway. The dropped bag of groceries has vanished.
Quotes

David Mills: Wait, I thought all you did was kill innocent people.

John Doe: Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? An obese man... a disgusting man who could barely stand up; a man who if you saw him on the street, you'd point him out to your friends so that they could join you in mocking him; a man, who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. After him, I picked the lawyer and I know you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one. This is a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath that he could muster to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets!

David Mills: Murderers?

John Doe: A woman...

David Mills: Murderers, John, like yourself?

John Doe: [interrupts] A woman... so ugly on the inside she couldn't bear to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside. A drug dealer, a drug dealing pederast, actually! And let's not forget the disease-spreading whore! Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever.

Crazy credits
SPOILER: Kevin Spacey's name is not included in the opening titles to keep the John Doe intrigue going. To compensate, he is listed twice in the closing credits: once before the credits start rolling and once in the rolling credits in order of appearance.
Alternate versions

USA laserdisc edition adds a few scenes deleted from theatrical release as a bonus at the end of the program, including: a prologue where Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is going to buy a country house. He uses his switchblade (seen many times in the final cut, but not explained) to cut out a small piece of wallpaper. There is an extended scene at the Mills' when David (Brad Pitt) is playing with his dogs, and Somerset talks to Tracy. He tells her about the house and shows her the wallpaper. She tells him that it wouldn't be such a good idea to show it to David, saying ""He wouldn't understand."". These two scenes establish Somerset's characters better, and the second one helps the viewer understand why the wife chooses Somerset to talk to when she gets pregnant. She knows that Somerset is much more sensible than her husband, and will understand her. The second one however was probably dumped earlier since it is included among the dailies and outtakes and the first one appears as a deleted scene.

FEATURED REVIEW

/10
Very grim and disturbing but you can't stop watching

Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.

Trivia
For the nighttime chase scenes, the headlights of the trucks and cars were replaced by aircraft landing lights for extra brightness. This helped to bring down the exposure enough to keep the sky consistently black even at early dawn.
Goofs
As Lewis, Venna, and Fuller are driving out to the corn field, Fuller is wearing a blue shirt with a brown jacket. While running through the corn field away from Rusty Nail, however, Fuller is wearing a cop's hat and cop's jacket, obviously from the original ending.
Quotes

Rusty Nail: [34:11] Apologize.

Fuller Thomas: No. Listen, you sick fuck, you pathetic, lonely, walkie-talkie, freak-show motherfucker. You're not getting anything from me. Know why? Because I have something that's more powerful than your psychosis. It's called a volume knob, and the only thing I have to do to make you go away is to turn it counterclockwise. You got that? You copy that?

Rusty Nail: You know, Black Sheep, you really ought to get that fixed.

Fuller Thomas: Get what fixed?

Rusty Nail: Your taillight.

FEATURED REVIEW
Good little chiller
Joy Ride is a good scary movie. What makes the film scary is the lack of a monster, the villain is a real crazy guy who can easily find you.John Dahl makes the film suspenseful with it's dark tone and swift camera angles and the cast all play their roles effectively. I give it *** out of ****.

FEATURED REVIEW

Flavorless but You Could Do Worse

I start this review by first acknowledging there's nothing wrong with this film from a family-oriented entertainment point of view. It's colorful, it's fun at times, provides a positive message about acceptance and provides a clever enough high concept to keep the kids on their keesters for 80 minutes. As a rudimentary children's film, you certainly can do worse.

The problem with The Secret Lives of Pets stems from its complete inability to marry story, character and concept into a discernible package. As it stands, the film is rushed, bulky and is chalked full of nonsensical choices that cripples any verdant ideas that could have been. It's a first draft; not a final product.

The story begins with a happy Jack Russell Terrier named Max (C.K.) who lives with his owner Katie (Kemper) in a surprisingly roomy Manhattan apartment. Things change drastically and suddenly with the arrival of Duke (Stonestreet) a large, shaggy Newfoundland whose introduced as a ""new brother"" to Max's chagrin. They, of course don't get along and after a series of confrontations find themselves lost. The first to notice they're missing is a lovestruck Pomeranian named Gidget (Slate) who recruits the rest of Max's friends among others to recover them from the vast streets of New York City.

The rest of Max's friends are barely worth mentioning as they're mostly utilized to push the buttons and pull the levers on some uninspired comedic set-pieces. They're not really useful to the plot, nor do they succeed in being the Toy Story (1995)-inspired resilient and diverse gaggle the movie hopes they are. Part of the reason for this is none of the side characters actually solve any problems. They jet here, they jet there but when faced with any obstacles they just seem to rush it. Gone is the creativity of having Mr. Potato Head fashion a new body out of a tortilla; now we have elderly Basset Hound, Pops (Carvey) hobbling through construction sites with stalwart confidence.

Frankly focusing on the story's tagged-on villains might have paid more dividends. The broad machinations of Snowball (Hart), a bunny with delusions of grandeur are easily the best part of the film, even if they remain painfully underdeveloped. Additionally his ""Flushed Pets"" group could have complicated Duke's allegiance to his new owner or more easily pegged Max as a fully socialized pet and therefore in need of re-education. Snowball was the best chance the movie had in getting audiences to truly know the characters we're supposed to be rooting for but instead they blew it on prolonged chase sequences and a sausage factory bit that goes absolutely nowhere.

And that gets me to the biggest problem I have with this film; the creators' approach to the high concept itself. The film tries to have its cake and eat it to, portraying characters with innately human characteristics but still clinging to the charming pet-like idiosyncrasies we know and love about our furry friends. For example, Gidget recruits the help of Tiberius (Brooks) a hawk who at first tries to eat her. She barely escapes his talons only to trust him once more because that's just what a peppy little dog would do. Max's friends Mel (Moynihan) and Buddy (Buress) don't even notice Max is gone because, being dogs, they're distracted by butterflies and squirrels. They're certainly not a rag-tag group of lovable rogues, they're a confederacy of dunces, successful only because of the ever changing allegiances of the main antagonist. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention Snowball at one point joins forces with Max to save Duke in a climactic sequence so blithely unnatural it renders the friends search and rescue completely moot.

This film is a rushed, characterless, flavorless kids film that just barely stretches its plot over the skeleton of its story structure. As I said before, if all you're looking for is a bland and forgettable family film, you could do worse. Yet provided it's appealing concept, you'd really think the animation studio that made Despicable Me (2010) could do better.

Rowling even provided him with vital details of Snape's backstory, not revealed until the final novel.Goofs(at around 1h 11 mins) When Harry is upside down with the troll holding him by his legs, his hair is pointing to the floor and his scar is no where to be seen on his forehead.QuotesDumbledore: It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.Crazy creditsRichard Bremmer (the face and voice of Lord Voldemort) is credited as ""He Who Must Not Be Named"", Lord Voldemort's title.Alternate versionsThere is an extended cut of the film running about 159 minutes vs the theatrical version runs 152 minutes. It was first shown on TV networks (ABC in the US, several international broadcasts had the same extended showing) in 2004. The 2009 Ultimate Edition DVD/Blu-ray release includes this cut as well.
The deleted scenes added back into the movie are:

This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least.

For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron ManWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.Plus our the villains are so well done..But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.helpful•422138cafesmittyDec 21, 2018Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ19How long is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateDecember 20, 2018 (Netherlands)Countries of originCanadaUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial SiteLanguagesEnglishSpanishAlso known asSpider-Man: Into the Spider-VerseProduction companiesColumbia PicturesMarvel EntertainmentAvi Arad ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$90,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$190,241,310Opening weekend US & Canada$35,363,376Dec 16, 2018Gross worldwide$384,298,736See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 57 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosDolby Surround 7.112-Track Digital SoundDolby DigitalSDDSAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a 2013 American adventure comedy-drama film directed, co-produced by and starring Ben Stiller and written by Steve Conrad. The film also stars Kristen Wiig, Shirley MacLaine, Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, and Sean Penn.[7][8] It is the second film adaptation of James Thurber's 1939 short story of the same name,[9] following the 1947 film.
Following its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on October 5, 2013,[10] The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was theatrically released by 20th Century Fox on December 25, 2013, in North America to generally mixed reception. It was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2013.[11] The film was released with a soundtrack.


Plot[edit]

Walter Mitty is a negative assets manager at Life magazine living alone in New York City. He chronically daydreams and has a secret crush on Cheryl Melhoff, a coworker. Walter attempts to contact Cheryl via eHarmony but eHarmony customer service agent Todd Mahar explains that Walter's account is not fully filled out: the ""been there"" and ""done that"" sections are blank.
Walter works with legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell, although they have never met in person. At work later that day, Walter receives a negative roll from Sean with a wallet as a gift in appreciation of Walter's work over the years. A letter from Sean explains that he believes negative #25 captures the ""quintessence of life"" and should be used for the cover of the magazine's final print issue before it becomes exclusively digital, yet the negative is missing from the roll. Ted Hendricks, the obnoxious manager of the magazine's transition, has also heard Sean's recommendation. When he asks about #25, Walter stalls and lies, worried about being fired. Walter then asks Cheryl for help, and she suggests that Walter use the other negatives as clues to Sean's location. He and Hernando, his understudy, are stumped by a negative depicting a curve, until they notice another containing the name of a ship registered in Greenland. Walter reluctantly takes a plane there.
A bartender in Nuuk explains that Sean left on a ship. To find him, Mitty would need to go on the postal helicopter, and the pilot is drunk. Mitty recognizes the pilot's thumb from one of the negatives, and after hesitating, joins the pilot on a trip to bring supplies to the ship. Walter accidentally jumps into ice-cold, shark-infested waters, losing the ship's supplies and preventing radio communication when he finally comes aboard. There, Walter learns that Sean departed the ship a few days earlier and deduces from notes on wrapping paper for a clementine cake Sean left behind that he is heading to Iceland to photograph the volcano Eyjafjallajökull. Walter bikes, skateboards, and runs through the Icelandic countryside to find Sean, but just misses him as the volcano erupts. Dejected, he returns home.
Ted assumes that Walter misplaced the negative and fires him. He tries to visit Cheryl, but spots her ex-husband and leaves before talking to her. Walter visits his mother and throws away the wallet from Sean. To his surprise, Walter recognizes the curve of the piano in his mother's house while looking at the last negative. When asked, she tells Walter that she met Sean and baked him the clementine cake. She had told Walter earlier, but he was daydreaming.
Walter figures out from the notes that Sean is in the Afghan Himalayas and finds him photographing a rare snow leopard. When asked about the negative, Sean explains that, attempting to be playful, he had placed the negative in the wallet. He decides not to tell Walter what the picture actually depicts. When Walter returns to America, the airport security at Los Angeles detains him for arriving from Afghanistan. To verify his identity, Walter calls the only person he knows in Los Angeles: Todd, who has kept in contact during Mitty's travels. The two chat and Todd expresses admiration for how adventurous Walter appears.
Walter receives the wallet from his mother, who had retrieved it from the trash, and finally obtains the negative but chooses not to see it. Emboldened, he delivers it to Life's offices and berates Hendricks for disrespecting the staff that made the magazine so honored.
Walter reunites with Cheryl, and thanks her for inspiring him on his journey. Cheryl eagerly asks about his adventures and tells him that her ex-husband had only been at her house to help with repairs. Walking along the street, they see the final print issue on sale at a newsstand, and on its cover, they see the photograph from #25 for the first time: it shows Walter sitting outside of the Life building, examining a contact sheet; the magazine is dedicated to Life's staff, and Sean's note actually referred to ""quintessence of Life"". Walter and Cheryl continue their walk holding hands.

Production[edit]
Development[edit]
Producer Samuel Goldwyn, Jr., whose father produced the 1947 film adaptation, conceived the idea of doing a remake in 1994; he had Jim Carrey in mind for the title role. Walt Disney Pictures was eager to purchase the remake rights, but Goldwyn instead chose New Line Cinema,[12] which had a positive working relationship with Carrey on Dumb and Dumber and The Mask (both 1994).[13] New Line Cinema bought the rights in 1995 with the understanding that The Samuel Goldwyn Company would be involved in creative decisions.[14] Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz turned in the first draft of the screenplay in July 1997. Ron Howard entered negotiations to direct the same month, and to cover producing duties with Brian Grazer and Imagine Entertainment.[15] Howard and Imagine Entertainment eventually left the project in favor of EDtv,[12] and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty languished in development hell over the challenges of using a contemporary storyline.[13]
In May 1999, New Line hired The Mask director Chuck Russell to rewrite the script and serve as Howard's replacement. Filming was set to begin in early 2000, but was pushed back.[13] Around this time, Peter Tolan worked on rewrites.[12] In May 2001, Goldwyn filed a lawsuit against New Line for breach of contract. Goldwyn claimed that the studio extended their 1995 deal until May 2001, but then announced that it wanted to transfer the rights for the remake to another company and have Goldwyn surrender his creative input.[14] In November 2002, New Line was forced to revert the film rights back to Goldwyn, who won his lawsuit and took the property to Paramount Pictures.[14] During pre-production discussions between Paramount and DreamWorks on Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (which starred Carrey), Steven Spielberg, head of DreamWorks, rekindled interest in working with Carrey; the duo previously considered Meet the Parents, but the outing fell apart.[12] In May 2003, Spielberg agreed to direct,[12] and brought in DreamWorks to co-finance The Secret Life of Walter Mitty with Paramount (which would acquire DreamWorks in 2006).[16]
By November 2003, Zach Helm was rewriting the script,[17] but Spielberg and DreamWorks vacated the film in April 2004 in favor of War of the Worlds and Munich. ""The goal is to go back to the short story and capture not only the content but the original spirit,"" producer John Goldwyn (son of Samuel) told The Hollywood Reporter. Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese entered discussion to write a new script following Spielberg's departure.[18] Samuel Goldwyn commented that LaGravenese's script had a momentous and unique approach compared to others. ""I'd always felt that unless we got a great script, the movie disintegrates into a series of wonderful gags,"" Goldwyn explained. ""Writers always fixated on that. [Richard] worked for 10 months on umpteen drafts, and he solved it.""[19] In March 2005, Paramount hired Mark Waters to direct LaGravenese's script for Walter Mitty,[20] but Carrey had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts.[19] He was soon replaced by Owen Wilson.[21]
Despite not having a final budget, Paramount scheduled a December 12, 2005, start date because their option on the remake rights was to end one week later; they would lose the rights if they did not start filming before December 20.[19] Wilson dropped out in October 2005 over creative differences. The Hollywood Reporter also speculated that Walter Mitty began to falter after Paramount failed to cast a female lead to star opposite Wilson. Scarlett Johansson had emerged as the front-runner for the role of Cheryl Melhoff after screen testing with Wilson earlier in October, but a deal was never signed with the actress.[22][23] Paramount executives Brad Grey and Gail Berman decided to put Walter Mitty in turnaround in November 2005.[24] Goldwyn found favor at 20th Century Fox and, in May 2007, it was announced that Mike Myers was attached to star in the title role. Jay Kogen was hired to write a new script that would be specifically tailored for Myers.[25]
In April 2010, Sacha Baron Cohen was offered and accepted the lead role.[26] Later that month, The Pursuit of Happyness writer Steven Conrad was hired to pen the screenplay,[27] with Gore Verbinski announced as director in June 2010.[28][29][30]
In April 2011, it was announced that Ben Stiller had been cast in the lead role, though no director was attached.[31] The following July, it was announced that Stiller was also going to direct the film.[32]

Pre-production[edit]
In January 2012, it was announced that Kristen Wiig would play the female lead,[33] with Shirley MacLaine to play Walter's mother.[34] This was followed by reports in February that Patton Oswalt and Adam Scott had joined the film.[35][36] In April 2012, Kathryn Hahn was cast as Odessa, Walter's sister, and Josh Charles was cast as the ex-husband of Kristen Wiig's character,[37] though he was replaced by Kai Lennox. Later that month, Sean Penn was cast in what was described as a ""small but pivotal supporting role""[38] as photojournalist Sean O'Connell.
The portions of the film set in Nuuk, Greenland, were in fact shot in Stykkishólmur, a village on the Snæfellsnes peninsula in Iceland, and Höfn, a village in southeast Iceland. Later sequences set in Stykkishólmur were actually filmed in Seyðisfjörður. The sequences where Walter Mitty follows Sean to Afghanistan were also filmed in Iceland, at the Skogafoss waterfall and in Vatnajökull National Park.[39]
During the skateboarding scene in Central Park, pro skater Rodney Mullen served as Ben Stiller's stunt double.[40]

Release[edit]
In April 2013, nearly 20 minutes of footage was presented by Fox at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, followed by a theatrical trailer release in July, both of which began to spark awards speculation.[41][42][43]
The film made its world premiere as the Centerpiece Gala presentation at the New York Film Festival on October 5, 2013.[10] It was also selected to serve as the Centerpiece Gala presentation at the 2013 AFI Film Festival.[44]

Marketing[edit]
20th Century Fox hired filmmaker Casey Neistat to make a promotional video based on the theme of ""live your dreams"", but Neistat suggested instead to spend the budget on bringing disaster relief to the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. Fox agreed and gave him a budget of $25,000.[45][46]

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 15, 2014, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.[47]

Reception[edit]
Critical response[edit]
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty received polarized reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 52% based on reviews from 198 critics, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site's consensus reads: ""It doesn't lack for ambition, but The Secret Life of Walter Mitty fails to back up its grand designs with enough substance to anchor the spectacle.""[48] Metacritic gives the film a normalized score of 54 out of 100 based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[49] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a B+ rating.[50]
Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com gave the film a scathing review, writing that it ""grated on my nerves...while everything Stiller attempts here has a real professional polish, what Mitty lacks is any sense of what life might actually be like for the kind of 'ordinary man' Mitty represents.""[51] Peter Debruge of Variety magazine criticized the film for lacking the satirical tone of the original story, comparing the film to ""a feature-length 'Just Do It' ad"" for the middle-aged audience the film was targeting. Debruge noted that the script downplayed the comedy, and that a scene inspired by The Curious Case of Benjamin Button shows the film could have been made funnier, but that the more serious emotional dimension ultimately made the film feel more substantial.[52]
The film had its share of admirers. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a positive review, saying ""In his uniquely funny and unexpectedly tender movie, Stiller takes us on a personal journey of lingering resonance.""[53] Joe Neumaier of New York Daily awarded the film five out of five stars, saying ""The story Stiller tells manages to float in a most peculiar, satisfying way.""[54] Political radio show host and film critic Michael Medved was also positive concerning the film, calling it ""one of the feel-good movies of the year.""
The film was criticized for the product placement of several brands which featured prominently in the storyline.[55][56]
In 2016, Rolling Stone magazine asked readers to choose their top 10 Ben Stiller movies. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was rated as Stiller's third-best film.[57]

Soundtrack[edit]
Main article: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (soundtrack)
The film features the following songs:

""Maneater"" – Performed by Grace Mitchell
""Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"" – Written by Rupert Holmes
""Wake Up"" – Performed by Arcade Fire
""Don't You Want Me"" – Written by Phil Oakey, Philip Adrian Wright (as Philip Wright), and Jo Callis
""Far Away"" – Performed by José González
""Far Away"" – Performed by Junip
""Space Oddity"" – Performed by David Bowie and Kristen Wiig (uncredited)
""Lake Michigan"" – Performed by Rogue Wave
""Dirty Paws"" – Performed by Of Monsters and Men
""The Wolves and the Ravens"" – Performed by Rogue Valley (Chris Koza)
""Stay Alive"" – Performed by José González
""Step Out"" – Performed by José González
""Don't Let It Pass"" – Performed by Junip
""Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"" – Performed by Jack Johnson
""#9 Dream"" – Performed by José González, written by John Lennon
""Space Oddity""[edit]
The song ""Space Oddity"" by David Bowie plays a significant role throughout the film. Walter Mitty is referred to mockingly as ""Major Tom"" by his new boss, Hendricks, in reference to the astronaut Major Tom in ""Space Oddity"", due to his frequent daydreaming: the boss interprets the line ""ground control to Major Tom"" as akin to ""Earth to Walter; come in Walter"". Cheryl later tells Walter that Hendricks misunderstands the song, as ""it’s about courage and venturing into the unknown"".[63]
The song is featured in a crucial scene in which Mitty decides to leap onto a helicopter after imagining Cheryl singing the song. Stiller talked about the importance of ""Space Oddity"" in that scene during an interview in which he said that, ""I felt like the way it fits into the story, we got to this point and this scene which was sort of how the fantasy and reality come together for Walter, and that was what that came out of. That song, and what he mentioned in his head, and what he imagines and what he does, it all just seemed to come together over that song.""[64]

I've seen both of them do fantastic jobs with decent scripts. This film...does not have one of those.Holmes and Watson could have been great - after all, the Sherlock Holmes character, being such a cultural icon, is ripe for parody. But this movie does NOTHING with its premise. In fact, most of the script could just have been copy-pasted from your standard brainless buddy comedy set in modern America, with barely any changes.For one thing, the film has barely any plot - instead, the titular characters simply stumble from one scene to the next, encountering various people of no real consequence (even Moriarty - played by the fantastic Ralph Finnes, a casting choice that would have been so much better in a serious adaptation - is barely in the movie and feels like an afterthought). And sure, not every comedy needs a strong plot; but when you're making a film about Sherlock Holmes, whose very character is built on strong murder mystery plots, you need to at least ATTEMPT to give your parody something of a story.And for another, the jokes are just painful. As mentioned, most of them barely relate to the Sherlock Holmes character at all - they're just standard slapstick jokes transplanted into a Victorian setting, with barely any changes; or else painful attempts at being ""topical"" that'll feel horrendously outdated in a few months. The film makes no real effort to satirise the Holmes character - in fact, it never makes us feel like we're watching Sherlock Holmes or John Watson on the screen at all. Instead, we just feel like we're watching Will Ferrell and John C Reilly faffing around in costumes and putting on dumb accents, and the film never tries to convince us otherwise.It's just low-effort tripe beginning to end. Modern comedy feels like a cesspit sometimes.helpful•15556PhelixRothJul 15, 2019Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ20How long is Holmes & Watson?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJanuary 10, 2019 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesCanadaOfficial siteOfficial SiteLanguageEnglishAlso known asHolmes & WatsonFilming locationsHampton Court Palace, East Molesey, Surrey, England, UKProduction companiesColumbia PicturesGary Sanchez ProductionsMimran Schur PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$42,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$30,573,626Opening weekend US & Canada$7,411,522Dec 30, 2018Gross worldwide$40,466,970See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 30 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDolby Surround 7.1Dolby AtmosAuro 11.1IMAX 6-TrackAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the Hindi language plot outline for Holmes (2018)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Corpse Bride (also known as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride) is a 2005 stop-motion animated musical fantasy film[4] directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton from a screenplay by John August, Caroline Thompson, and Pamela Pettler, based on characters created by Burton and Carlos Grangel. The plot is set in a fictional Victorian era village in England. Johnny Depp leads the cast as the voice of Victor, while Helena Bonham Carter voices Emily, the titular bride. An international co-production between the United States and United Kingdom and produced by Tim Burton Productions and Laika Entertainment, Corpse Bride is the third stop-motion feature film produced by Burton and the first directed by him (the previous two films, 1993's The Nightmare Before Christmas and 1996's James and the Giant Peach, were directed by Henry Selick). This is also the first stop-motion feature from Burton that was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.
Corpse Bride is based on a 17th-century Jewish folktale, which Joe Ranft introduced to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas. Work on the film started in November 2003 when Burton was completing Big Fish (2003). He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Production of the stop-motion animation feature took place at 3 Mills Studios in East London. It was shot with Canon EOS-1D Mark II digital SLRs, rather than the 35 mm film cameras used for Burton's previous stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. The film was dedicated to executive producer Joe Ranft, who died during production.
Corpse Bride premiered at the 62nd Venice International Film Festival on September 7, 2005, and was released in theaters on September 23, 2005, in the United States and on October 13, 2005, in the United Kingdom. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $118.1 million worldwide against its $40 million budget and received critical praise for its animation, characters, songs, and humor. The film won the National Board of Review for Best Animated Feature, and was nominated for the 78th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature. The film won the Annie Awards Ub Iwerks Award for Technical Achievement in 2006, where it was also nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Character Design, and Best Direction.


Plot[edit]
In an unnamed Victorian era town, Victor Van Dort, the son of nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the neglected daughter of impoverished aristocrats, prepare for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of the Van Dort family and restore the wealth of the Everglot family (""According to Plan""). Although the two are initially nervous, they become smitten and fall in love instantly when they meet; however, the nervous Victor ruins their wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, dropping the ring, and accidentally setting Lady Everglot's dress on fire. Fleeing to a nearby forest, he successfully rehearses his vows with a tree and places his wedding ring on an upturned root. However, the root is revealed to be the skeletal finger of a dead girl named Emily gowned in a wedding dress, who rises from the grave, proclaims herself as Victor's new wife, and spirits him away to the Land of the Dead, a realm far more colorful and whimsical.
During his time with Emily, Victor learns that she was murdered years earlier on the night of her elopement by her fiancé, who stole the family jewels and gold she had brought (""Remains of the Day""). Emily reunites Victor with his long-dead dog, Scraps, and they bond. However, desperate to return to Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into returning them to the Land of the Living by claiming he wants her to meet his parents. Emily brings Victor to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, who grants them temporary passage. Victor reunites with Victoria and confesses his wish to marry her as soon as possible. Before the pair can share a kiss, Emily discovers them and, feeling betrayed and hurt, drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead (""Tears to Shed""). Emily confronts Victor and claims Victoria to be the other woman, but Victor says she is the other woman and he didn’t want to marry her. Victoria tries to tell her parents of Victor's situation, but nobody believes her and they assume he has left her and she is going insane. Against her will, Victoria's parents decide to marry her to Lord Barkis Bittern, a presumed-wealthy visitor who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.
After reconciling with Emily, Victor learns of Victoria's impending marriage to Barkis from his family's newly deceased coachman Mayhew. Upset over this news, Victor decides to marry Emily properly, learning that this will require him to repeat his wedding vows with her in the Land of the Living and drink the Wine of Ages, a poison, in order to join Emily in death. The dead swiftly prepare for the ceremony and head ""upstairs"" (""The Wedding Song""), where the town erupts into a temporary panic upon their arrival until the living recognize their departed loved ones and joyously reunite with them. The chaos causes a panicked Barkis to expose his own poor financial standing and his intentions to marry Victoria only for her supposed wealth, leading her to reject him.
Victoria witnesses Victor and Emily's wedding as Victor completes his vows and prepares to drink the poison, only for Emily to stop him when she realizes she is denying Victoria her chance to live happily with him. Just as Emily reunites Victor and Victoria, Barkis arrives to kidnap Victoria; Emily recognizes Barkis as both her previous fiancé and murderer. Victor duels with Barkis to protect Victoria, and Emily intervenes to save Victor's life. Accepting defeat, Barkis mockingly toasts Emily for dying unwed and unwittingly drinks the poison, causing him to die and allowing the dead – who cannot interfere in the affairs of the living – to take retribution against him for his crimes. Emily, now freed from her torment, releases Victor of his vow to marry her and returns his ring, allowing him to marry Victoria. As she steps into the moonlight, she transforms into a swarm of butterflies that fly into the sky as Victor and Victoria watch and embrace.

Production[edit]
Development[edit]
The film is based on a 17th-century Jewish folktale, which Joe Ranft introduced to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas.[6] The film began production in November 2003, while Burton was completing Big Fish.[7] He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film.[7] Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: ""In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another. Our approach was more organic. Tim knew where he wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to hit. My job was to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage as close as possible to how I thought he wanted it.""[7]

Filming[edit]
Tim Burton co-directed the film.
The film was originally supposed to have been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology.[7] In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors.[7] After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally.[7] In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop-motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot.[7] Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital.[7] After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm).[7] Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: ""One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew that we were going to be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics.""[7]
Animation took place at 3 Mills Studios in East London.[7] A dozen animators/puppeteers were put to work when production began, but that number had tripled by the end of production.[7] The initial group spent time developing each puppet's unique characteristics.[7] The puppets themselves, built by Mackinnon and Saunders, were typically about 17 inches tall and animated on sets built three to four feet off the ground with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets' surfaces to manipulate the puppets.[7] The three primary characters—Victor, Victoria and Corpse Bride—were fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets' faces.[7] The animators' work was spread over 25 to 35 individual setups/stages, each having its own Canon digital camera.[7] A total of 32 cameras were used on the film.[7] Each camera was outfitted with a ""grabber"" system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short ""reel"" of the shot being produced to check their work.[7]
The film's images were stored on a 1GB image card that was capable of holding approximately 100 frames of animation.[7] Eight roving camera teams—each team including a lighting cameraman, an assistant, a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues—worked with the animators to set up shots.[7] Each camera team had a ""lighting station"" workstation—comprising an Apple G4 computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing—to view TIFF file versions of the camera's images.[7] Once a shot was approved, the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their still camera and ""grabber"" computer/camera system to check their work.[7] The film's story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team, saying: ""We shot as close to a 1:1 film ratio [one take per shot] as we could because there was no time for reshoots. We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process—as many ways as needed—to get the scene how we wanted it. There was no coverage, as there would be for a live-action film.""[7]
Co-director Johnson would go over each scene with the animators, sometimes acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a ""dope sheet""—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key ""hits"". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on ""2s"" or ""4s"" (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation).[7] Johnson explained: ""The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in and see how it played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot.""[7] The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation.[7] Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of ""data wranglers."" Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a ""color cube.""[7] Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: ""The color cube is a 3-D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it.""[7] The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.[7]

Visual effects[edit]
Johnny Depp filmed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and recorded dialogue for Corpse Bride simultaneously.
Visual effects were delivered by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and were applied to the 1,000 or so shots in the film, though most of the effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements—groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CGI, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements.[7] Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: ""The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real person. You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they're looking at.""[7]
In a 2005, interview with About.com, Burton spoke about the differences between directing  Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: ""The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process.""[8] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: ""It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so it might have been a little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [together]. They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [Finney] and Joanna [Lumley] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other.""[8]

Critical response[edit]
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""As can be expected from a Tim Burton movie, Corpse Bride is whimsically macabre, visually imaginative, and emotionally bittersweet.""[17] Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 based on top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 83 based on 35 reviews, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[18] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.[19]
Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying, ""This macabre musical about a young bridegroom who mistakenly weds a girl from beyond the grave is an endearingly schizoid Frankenstein of a movie, by turns relentlessly high-spirited and darkly poignant.""[20] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it ""A wondrous flight of fancy, a stop-motion-animated treat brimming with imaginative characters, evocative sets, sly humor, inspired songs and a genuine whimsy that seldom finds its way into today's movies.""[21]
Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying, ""The variety of its cadaverous style is never less than inspired; never has the human skull's natural grin been redeployed so exhaustively for yuks.""[22] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying, ""As an achievement in macabre visual wizardry, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has to be reckoned some sort of marvel.""[23]
Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying, ""Cinema's reinvigorated fixation with the living dead suggests that we are in the grip of an impossible longing, or perhaps it's just another movie cycle running its course. Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom.""[24] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end.""[25]
Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""Ghoulishness and innocence walk hand-in-hand in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, a movie that digs into Hollywood's past to resurrect the antique art of stop-motion animation and create a fabulous bauble of a movie.""[21] Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Stop-motion animation may be the hardest and most tedious job in Hollywood, but the makers of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride deserve a couple of years in Tahiti celebrating their effort.""[21] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is an instant classic.""[21]
Lisa Rose of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film three out of five stars, saying, ""Corpse Bride offers unclassifiable enchantment.""[21] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""As animated films go, this is easily the best of a weak year.""[26] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying, ""If his The Nightmare Before Christmas from a dozen years back was a treat for the eyes and mind, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride goes double or nothing by being a delight for the ears and also the heart.""[21] Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film a B+, saying, ""Beneath the bone pile of allusions, Corpse Bride is a darkly enchanting fable in its own right.""[21]
Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer gave the film a negative review, saying, ""Corpse Bride turns out to be a ponderous mixture of puppetry and animation that is far too technologically complex and laborious for this hopelessly Luddite reviewer.""[21] Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it ""A sweet and visually lovely tale of love lost.""[27] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars, saying, ""The sweetness, the visual flourishes and inspired pieces of casting carry the Corpse Bride, if not all the way down the primrose path, then at least across the threshold.""[28] Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""If Nightmare Before Christmas was a jazzy pop number, Corpse Bride is a waltz—an elegant, deadly funny bit of macabre matrimony.""[29]
Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film two out of five stars, saying, ""The film does have a fairy-tale aspect, but, like many of its characters, it is more dead and buried than fully alive.""[21] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Corpse Bride is an unexpectedly touching celebration of love told in a quirky and inventive style.""[30] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying, ""In the guise of a family film, Burton evokes a darkly erotic obsession that recalls Edgar Allan Poe and Hitchcock's Vertigo. It would be a test for any filmmaker, and Burton aces it.""[21]
Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is easily the best stop-motion animated necrophiliac musical romantic comedy of all time. It is also just simply, wonderful: a morbid, merry tale of true love that dazzles the eyes and delights the soul.""[21] Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Corpse Bride will win your heart, if it doesn't rip it out of your chest first.""[31] Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press gave the film three out of four stars, saying, ""There's a happy Halloween in store even for children who aren't allowed to trick or treat, and it's courtesy of Tim Burton's animated Corpse Bride.""[21]
Bruce Westbrook of The Houston Chronicle gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Amazingly fluid and drop-dead gorgeous, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is the best-looking, stop-motion animation film ever.""[32] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Corpse Bride suffers from the same problem that has plagued Burton's recent live-action films: for all its formidable razzle-dazzle, it doesn't engage the heart.""[21] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, ""This vibrantly imaginative mix of horror and humor puts the f-u-n in funeral.""[21]

Several businesses had to close down for two weeks. This was the biggest movie production in Austrian capital since Mission Impossible 5 (2015).GoofsWhen Idris Elba's character is drinking a beer from a bottle in the beginning of the movie, in the second shot you can clearly see he's almost finishing the beer, in the next shot it's half full.QuotesMia: His[their son's] Mia: last image of you wasn't you walking out on him.

But I found the plot, the motives, the backstory all much more interesting in this movie than the first one. Also liked Idris Elba's appearance. As seems to be the norm for this sort of movie, we got to see a variety of exotic firearms, from AKs with no stock to M240s and M249s to RPGs, PDWs, mini-guns, sniper weapons, etc. Also as usual, the weapons have extraordinary effect (not sure how you could get 40mm grenades to explode that close to the weapon that fired them) although hand-grenade explosions do seem to be close to accurate (the RPGs fly more like AT-4s though - RPGs don't really fire that accurately). Lots of bangs, lots of bashing, lots of knives (and axes and shovels and pitchforks), lots of shooting... but the plot actually has a start and a finish (and an opportunity for another one).helpful•15792ghatbkkJun 16, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ15How long is Extraction II?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJune 16, 2023 (Netherlands)Countries of originCzech RepublicAustriaAustraliaUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial NetflixLanguagesEnglishGeorgianFrenchGermanAlso known asExtraction IIFilming locationsVienna, Austria(DC Tower & surrounding area)Production companiesAGBOFilmhaus FilmsNetflixSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 2 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Extraction 2 (2023) officially released in the United Kingdom?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

9.46658E+15,2,"I recommend the Bollywood film ""Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani"" (2013). While it's not exclusively focused on Indian weddings, it includes vibrant and grand wedding sequences that capture the essence of Indian celebrations. The movie follows the journey of four friends through different stages of life, including weddings, and it offers a mix of romance, drama, and comedy.

It features beautiful wedding scenes, lively dance numbers, and explores the dynamics of friendships and relationships. ""Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani"" is known for its entertaining storytelling and visually appealing sequences, making it a great choice for a group of friends to enjoy together.

The director of Wake up Sid, which was a film where I really thought of Ranbir as an actor for the future.This film has a cast of some young and fresh actors who bring their A game to the table. Specially people like Aditya Roy Kapoor, Kalki, and of couse the ever charming Ranbir and Deepika. Their performances do give a fresh and joyous sense to the film.Coming to the plot, there is nothing you do not expect, A guy who lives a carefree and adventure filled life (Ranbir) and a girl who is like the one friend we all have and know is a book o'holic.(Deepika). This film does not surprise you with the plot or gives a twist or takes unexpected turns, but the actors and the screenplay makes up for it.Like almost each and every Karan Johar film, this one has that first half fun filled and second half emotion filled plot, if you know what I mean......The soundtrack delivered by Pritam is really foot tapping and catchy. Even with the emotional sogs, he does leave a mark. Don't be surprised if you find yourself humming some of the tunes even after you leave the hall. (Specially Subhanallah and Kabira)....Some of the locations of the film shot in manali which shows trekking are enjoyable... The main fault with the film is the plot itself and how it is presented in a clichéd manner. I don't have a problem with a used plot, but it could have been presented in a way that it does not get boring and too predictable. Guess the makers didn't want to take a risk.The characters in this film are well built and we connect to them. Even small roles like Ranbir's parents, Kalki, are well acted and most importantly relate-able. In the end this is a film with good acting, good premise, great locations, songs, but does get very much predictable and some times uninteresting. I give it a 7/10helpful•1518ksreekarMay 31, 2013Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ20How long is Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateMay 31, 2013 (Netherlands)Country of originIndiaOfficial sitesFilm SözlükMüzikal FilmlerLanguagesHindiEnglishFrenchAlso known asThis Youth Is CrazyFilming locationsUdaipur, Rajasthan, IndiaProduction companyDharma ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditGross US & Canada$3,827,466Opening weekend US & Canada$1,568,677Jun 2, 2013Gross worldwide$30,991,781See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 40 minutesColorColorRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the Spanish language plot outline for Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

But I found the plot, the motives, the backstory all much more interesting in this movie than the first one. Also liked Idris Elba's appearance. As seems to be the norm for this sort of movie, we got to see a variety of exotic firearms, from AKs with no stock to M240s and M249s to RPGs, PDWs, mini-guns, sniper weapons, etc. Also as usual, the weapons have extraordinary effect (not sure how you could get 40mm grenades to explode that close to the weapon that fired them) although hand-grenade explosions do seem to be close to accurate (the RPGs fly more like AT-4s though - RPGs don't really fire that accurately). Lots of bangs, lots of bashing, lots of knives (and axes and shovels and pitchforks), lots of shooting... but the plot actually has a start and a finish (and an opportunity for another one).helpful•15792ghatbkkJun 16, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ15How long is Extraction II?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJune 16, 2023 (Netherlands)Countries of originCzech RepublicAustriaAustraliaUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial NetflixLanguagesEnglishGeorgianFrenchGermanAlso known asExtraction IIFilming locationsVienna, Austria(DC Tower & surrounding area)Production companiesAGBOFilmhaus FilmsNetflixSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 2 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Extraction 2 (2023) officially released in the United Kingdom?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Isle of Dogs (Japanese: 犬ヶ島, Hepburn: Inu ga Shima, lit. 'Dog Island') is a 2018 stop-motion animated comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by Wes Anderson, narrated by Courtney B. Vance, and starring an ensemble cast that consists of Bryan Cranston, Koyu Rankin, Edward Norton, Liev Schreiber, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, Jeff Goldblum, Scarlett Johansson, Kunichi Nomura, Tilda Swinton, Ken Watanabe, Akira Ito, Greta Gerwig, Akira Takayama, Frances McDormand, F. Murray Abraham, Yojiro Noda, Fisher Stevens, Mari Natsuki, Nijiro Murakami, Yoko Ono, Harvey Keitel, and Frank Wood. A U.S.–German co-production, Isle of Dogs was produced by Indian Paintbrush and Anderson's own American Empirical Pictures, in association with Studio Babelsberg. The film is set in the fictional Japanese city of Megasaki where Mayor Kenji Kobayashi has banished all dogs to Trash Island due to a canine influenza pandemic. Kobayashi's nephew Atari sets out to find his missing dog Spots with the help of a group of dogs led by stray dog Chief.

Anderson started developing the film in October 2015 using stop-motion animation, with a voice cast of Norton, Cranston, and Balaban. It draws inspiration from films by Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki, as well as the stop-motion animated holiday specials made by Rankin/Bass Productions, the 1982 animated film The Plague Dogs, and Disney's 101 Dalmatians. Production began in October 2016 at the 3 Mills Studios in East London. By December 2016, Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film, scheduling it for a 2018 release.

Isle of Dogs opened the 68th Berlin International Film Festival, where Anderson was awarded the Silver Bear for Best Director. It was given a limited release in the United States on March 23, 2018, by Fox Searchlight, and went on wide release on April 13. It has grossed over $64 million worldwide, and received acclaim from critics, who praised its animation, story, musical score, and deadpan humor. The film received two nominations at the 91st Academy Awards, for Best Animated Feature and Best Score.

In the film, none of the Japanese dialogue spoken by human characters is translated except through an interpreter or occasional subtitles.

Plot
In 2048, an outbreak of canine flu spreads throughout Japan, including the fictitious city of Megasaki, with the risk of becoming contagious to humans. The city's authoritarian mayor, Kenji Kobayashi, ratifies an official decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, which is immediately approved despite the insistence of Professor Watanabe, the mayor's political opponent, who states he is close to creating a cure. The first deported canine is a white and black-spotted dog named Spots Kobayashi, who served as the bodyguard dog of 12-year-old orphan Atari Kobayashi, the mayor's distant nephew and ward.

Six months later, Atari hijacks a plane and flies it to Trash Island (now nicknamed ""Isle of Dogs"") to search for Spots as he has an emotional connection with him after the train crash incident he and his parents were in. After crash-landing, Atari is rescued by a dog pack ostensibly led by an all-black canine named Chief, a lifelong stray. With their help, Atari first finds a locked cage that apparently contains Spots' skeleton, but learns that it is not him. They then fend off a rescue team sent by Mayor Kobayashi to retrieve Atari. Atari decides to continue his search for Spots, and the pack decides to help him. Chief initially declines but is then convinced by Nutmeg, a female ex-show dog, to help the boy out of obligation. The pack seeks advice from sage-like dogs Jupiter and Oracle, who surmise that Spots might be held captive by an isolated tribe of dogs rumored to be cannibals.

Meanwhile, Watanabe finally develops a successful serum and shows the results to Kobayashi, who only dismisses him. The professor objects only to be put under house arrest and killed by a piece of poisoned sushi by order of the mayor's hatchet man Major Domo. Tracy Walker, an American exchange student and member of a pro-dog activist group, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. In the process of investigating, she gains feelings for Atari. Kobayashi and his political party are revealed to actually be responsible for the dog flu outbreak, seeking to eliminate the dogs after Kobayashi's cat-loving ancestors tried to do 1,000 years previously. They were foiled by a child samurai resembling Atari.

During their journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others. Atari gives Chief a bath, revealing his white and black-spotted coat and thus his striking resemblance to Spots. The two bond and rejoin the rest of the pack, and are saved by Spots and the dog tribe from another rescue team. Spots confirms that he is Chief's older brother and that he was rescued by the tribe, who were test subjects from a secret lab that was abandoned after a tsunami. Spots became their leader and mated with a female tribe member named Peppermint, who is pregnant with their first litter. Because of these circumstances, Spots requests for Atari to transfer his protection duties to Chief. Chief is initially hesitant, but both he and Atari accept, and bodyguard duties are officially transferred to Chief. An owl later brings word that Kobayashi has rounded up all the exiled dogs and plans to exterminate them with poison gas.

Tracy confronts Watanabe's closest colleague Yoko Ono, who confirms Tracy's conspiracy theories and gives her the last vial of serum. At his re-election ceremony, Kobayashi prepares to give the extermination order when Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption. Kobayashi proceeds to deport Tracy, but before he can do so, Atari and the dogs arrive. They confirm the serum works by testing it on Chief and curing him. Atari addresses the crowd and recites a haiku he wrote and dedicated to Kobayashi, rekindling the sympathy that once existed between dogs and humans.

Touched by Atari's words, Kobayashi officially rescinds the dog ban. Enraged, Major Domo yells at Mayor Kobayashi for breaking the Mayor's campaign promise, revealing that the role as a butler is a facade, and his true nature as an authoritarian figure with villainous goals is unveiled, and tries to kill Kobayashi and initiate the extermination himself, but thanks to Spots and the activists, Domo's plans are thwarted. Atari and Spots become gravely injured during the struggle and are taken to a hospital, where Kobayashi donates one of his kidneys to save his nephew. It is later revealed that while Kobayashi did win the election, he will not hold office because he was caught in a scandal. Therefore, all mayoral powers and authorities will transfer to his next-in-line, Atari.

One month later, Atari officially becomes the new mayor of Megasaki, and has all dogs reintegrated into society and cured of the dog flu, while Kobayashi and his propagandists and co-conspirators are sent to jail for political corruption, doing 30 days of community service, and paying fines of no less than ¥250,000, because a death sentence could be overkill. Atari and Tracy become a couple, while Chief and Nutmeg become their bodyguard dogs and begin a relationship. Meanwhile, Spots (recovering from his injuries) has had a statue erected in his honor and resumes raising his litter with Peppermint under the care of a priest at a Shinto house.

Isle of Dogs press conference at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival, February 2018
In October 2015, Anderson, who had previously directed the animated film Fantastic Mr. Fox, announced he would be returning to the art form with ""a film about dogs""[9] starring Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston and Bob Balaban.[10][11] Anderson has said that he was inspired by seeing a road sign for the Isle of Dogs in England while Fantastic Mr. Fox was in development.[12] Anderson said that the film was strongly influenced by the films of Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki, as well as the stop-motion animated holiday specials made by Rankin/Bass Productions, the 1982 animated film The Plague Dogs, and Disney's 101 Dalmatians.[13]

Filming
Production began in October 2016 at the 3 Mills Studios in East London.[14][15][16]

About 20,000 faces and 1,105 animatable puppets were crafted by ""12 sculptors working six days a week"" for the film; 2,000 more puppets were made for background characters. The detailed puppets of the main characters typically took 2–3 months to create.[17] The animation department included a number of people who had worked on Fantastic Mr. Fox.[18]

Virtual reality
Concurrently with the film, Félix and Paul Studios and FoxNext VR Studio collaborated on Isle of Dogs: Behind the Scenes (in Virtual Reality), an immersive video film that places the viewer directly inside the animated world.[19] The virtual reality film was released on the Google Pixel platform.[20]

Release
On December 23, 2016, Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film, with plans for a 2018 release.[26][27]

The film premiered as the opening film of the 68th Berlin International Film Festival on February 15, 2018, and had its North American premiere as the closing film of the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas, on March 17, 2018.[28] Isle of Dogs began a limited release in the U.S. on March 23, 2018.[29] It was released nationwide in the United States on April 13, 2018.[30][31][32]

Box office
Isle of Dogs has grossed $32 million in the United States and Canada, and $32.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $64.1 million.[6]

In its first weekend of limited release, the film made $1.57 million from 27 theaters (an average of $58,148 per venue). It was the best per-theater average of 2018 until it was overtaken by Eighth Grade in July.[30][33] Sixty percent of its audience was under the age of 30.[34] In its second weekend, the film made $2.8 million from 165 theaters (an increase of 74%), finishing 11th.[35] The film entered the top 10 in its third weekend, making $4.6 million from 554 theaters.[36] The film expanded to 1,939 theaters the following week and made $5.4 million, finishing seventh at the box office.[37]

Home media
Isle of Dogs was released digitally on June 26, 2018, and on DVD and Blu-ray on July 17, 2018.[38]

On streaming, Isle of Dogs was added on Disney+ in the US and Canada on January 15, 2021.[citation needed] It was added to the UK and Australian versions on 17 September 2021.[citation needed]

Reception
Critical response
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 367 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""The beautifully stop-motion animated Isle of Dogs finds Wes Anderson at his detail-oriented best while telling one of the director's most winsomely charming stories.""[39] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[40] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale,[34] while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an overall positive score of 88%.[41]

Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising it for taking risks, and saying: ""It's smart and different and sometimes deliberately odd and really funny—rarely in a laugh-out-loud way, more in a smile-and-nod-I-get-the-joke kind of way.""[42]

Portrayal of Japanese culture
Some critics have argued that the film is an example of racial stereotyping and cultural appropriation.[43] The Japanese characters speak unsubtitled Japanese, with their dialogue instead being translated by an interpreter or a machine. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote, ""It's in the director's handling of the story's human factor that his sensitivity falters, and the weakness for racial stereotyping that has sometimes marred his work comes to the fore ... Much of the Japanese dialogue has been pared down to simple statements that non-speakers can figure out based on context and facial expressions"". Angie Han, writing in Mashable, cites the American exchange student character Tracy as a ""classic example of the 'white savior' archetype—the well-meaning white hero who arrives in a foreign land and saves its people from themselves"".[43]

While this critique had created some furor on the film's release, Chang has said that his review had been taken out of context and turned into a ""battle cry"" on Twitter, adding, ""I wasn't offended; nor was I looking to be offended"".[44] A Japanese-American perspective was provided by Emily Yoshida, writing in New York magazine, that these concerns had been ""seen before in debates about Asian culture as reflected by Western culture—perspectives can vary wildly between Asian-Americans and immigrated Asians, and what feels like tribute to some feels like opportunism to others"".[45]

Writing for BuzzFeed, Alison Willmore found ""no overt malicious intent to Isle of Dogs' cultural tourism, but it's marked by a hodgepodge of references that an American like Anderson might cough up if pressed to free associate about Japan—taiko drummers, anime, Hokusai, sumo, kabuki, haiku, cherry blossoms, and a mushroom cloud (!). ... This all has more to do with the ... insides of Anderson's brain than it does any actual place. It's Japan purely as an aesthetic—and another piece of art that treats the East not as a living, breathing half of the planet but as a mirror for the Western imagination"".[46] She continued, ""in the wake of Isle of Dogs' opening weekend, there were multiple headlines wondering whether the film was an act of appropriation or homage. But the question is rhetorical—the two aren't mutually exclusive, and the former is not automatically off the table just because the creator's intent was the latter"".[46]

Conversely, Moeko Fujii wrote a favorable review for The New Yorker, complimenting the film's depiction of the Japanese and their culture, as well as pointing out that language is the key theme of the movie. Fujii wrote,

Anderson's decision not to subtitle the Japanese speakers struck me as a carefully considered artistic choice. Isle of Dogs is profoundly interested in the humor and fallibility of translation ... This is the beating heart of the film: there is no such thing as ""true"" translation. Everything is interpreted. Translation is malleable and implicated, always, by systems of power ... [the film] shows the seams of translation, and demarcates a space that is accessible—and funny—only to Japanese viewers.[47]

Fujii also deconstructed the criticisms of the character of Tracy Walker being a ""white savior"", and how this relates to the film's language theme, writing,

At a climactic moment, the movie rejects the notion of universal legibility, placing the onus of interpretation solely upon the American audience ... This is a sly subversion, in which the Japanese evince an agency independent of foreign validation. Indeed, to say that the scene dehumanizes the Japanese is to assume the primacy of an English-speaking audience. Such logic replicates the very tyranny of language that Isle of Dogs attempts to erode.[47]

Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto said in an interview to GQ Magazine regarding the film: ""I think it's a well-crafted movie. Its aesthetic is so perfect, I think. People could enjoy that. But as a Japanese, you know, to me, it's kind of the same thing again. Old Hollywood movies, they always used their mixed image of Japanese or Chinese or Korean or Vietnamese. It's a wrong stereotypical image of Asian people. So I cannot take it.""[48]

Accolades
Isle of Dogs received two Academy Awards, BAFTAs, and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Animated Feature and Original Score, making it the first PG-13 rated animation to be nominated for these awards.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (also known as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) is a 2001 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus and produced by David Heyman, from a screenplay by Steve Kloves, based on the 1997 novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling. It is the first instalment in the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Its story follows Harry's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his formal wizarding education.

Warner Bros. Pictures bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported £1 million ($1.65 million). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Columbus being chosen to helm the film from a short list of directors that included Steven Spielberg and Rob Reiner. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, with the three leads chosen in August 2000 following open casting calls. Filming took place at Leavesden Film Studios and historic buildings around the United Kingdom from September 2000 to March 2001.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 10 and 11 November 2001 for two days of previews. The film opened on 16 November in the United States, Canada, and Taiwan as well as officially in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $974 million at the worldwide box office during its initial run, and over $1 billion with subsequent re-releases. It became the highest-grossing film of 2001 and the second-highest-grossing film at the time. The film was nominated for many awards, including Academy Awards for Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. It was followed by seven sequels, beginning with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in 2002 and ending with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in 2011.

Plot
Late one night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, along with groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, deliver an orphaned infant wizard named Harry Potter to his Muggle aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley, his only living relatives.

Ten years later, just before Harry's eleventh birthday, owls begin delivering letters addressed to him. When the abusive Dursleys adamantly refuse to allow Harry to open any and flee to an island hut, Hagrid arrives to personally deliver Harry's letter of acceptance to Hogwarts. Hagrid also reveals that Harry's parents, James and Lily, were killed by a dark wizard named Lord Voldemort. The killing curse that Voldemort had cast towards Harry rebounded, destroying Voldemort's body and giving Harry his lightning-bolt scar. Hagrid then takes Harry to Diagon Alley for school supplies and gives him a pet snowy owl whom he names Hedwig. Harry buys a wand that is connected to Voldemort's own wand.

At King's Cross station, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express train, and meets fellow students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger during the journey. Arriving at Hogwarts, Harry also meets Draco Malfoy, who is from a wealthy wizard family; the two immediately form a rivalry. The students assemble in the Great Hall where the Sorting Hat sorts the first-years into four respective houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Harry is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione, while Draco is placed into Slytherin, a house noted for dark wizards.

As he studies magic, Harry learns more about his parents and Voldemort, and his innate talent for broomstick flying gets him recruited for the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the youngest Seeker in a century. While returning to the Gryffindor common room, the staircases change paths, leading Harry, Ron and Hermione to the third floor, which is forbidden to students. There they discover a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy. On Halloween, Ron insults Hermione after she shows off in Charms class. Upset, she spends the entire afternoon crying in the girls' bathroom. That evening, a giant marauding troll enters it but Harry and Ron save Hermione; they make up and become close friends after Hermione takes the blame for the incident by claiming she went looking for the troll.

The trio discover that Fluffy is guarding the philosopher's stone, a magical object that can turn metal into gold and produce an immortality elixir. Harry suspects that Severus Snape, the Potions teacher and head of the Slytherin House, wants the stone to return Voldemort to physical form. When Hagrid accidentally reveals that music puts Fluffy asleep, Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to find the stone before Snape. Fluffy is already asleep, but the trio face other barriers, including a deadly plant called Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys, and a giant chess game that knocks out Ron.

After overcoming the barriers, Harry encounters Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Quirinus Quirrell, who wants the stone; Snape had figured it out and had been protecting Harry. Quirrell removes his turban to reveal a weakened Voldemort living on the back of his head. Dumbledore's protective enchantment places the stone in Harry's possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for resurrecting his parents, but Harry sees through his trick and refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry. When Harry touches Quirrell's skin, it burns Quirrell, reducing him to ashes. Voldemort's soul rises from the pile and escapes, knocking out Harry as it passes through him.

Harry recovers in the school infirmary. Dumbledore tells him the stone has been destroyed to prevent misuse, and that Ron and Hermione are safe. He also reveals how Harry defeated Quirrell: when Lily died to save Harry, a love-based protection against Voldemort was placed on him. At the end-of-school-year feast, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded extra house points for their heroism, tying Gryffindor for first place with Slytherin; Dumbledore then awards ten points to their housemate Neville Longbottom for having had the courage to stand up to the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, happy to finally have a real home at Hogwarts.

Cast
Further information: List of Harry Potter cast members
Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter:
An 11-year-old orphan living with his unwelcoming aunt, uncle, and cousin, who learns of his own fame as a wizard known to have survived his parents' murder at the hands of the dark wizard Lord Voldemort as an infant when he is accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Columbus had wanted Radcliffe for the role since he saw him in the BBC's production of David Copperfield, before the open casting sessions had taken place, but had been told by casting director Susan Figgis that Radcliffe's protective parents would not allow their son to take the part.[6] Columbus explained that his persistence in giving Radcliffe the role was responsible for Figgis' resignation.[6] Radcliffe was asked to audition in 2000, when Heyman and Kloves met him and his parents at a production of Stones in His Pockets in London.[7] Heyman and Columbus successfully managed to convince Radcliffe's parents that their son would be protected from media intrusion, and they agreed to let him play Harry.[6] Rowling approved of Radcliffe's casting, stating that ""having seen [his] screen test I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.""[8] Radcliffe was reportedly paid £1 million for the film, although he felt the fee was ""not that important"" to him.[9] The Saunders triplets appear as Harry as a baby.[10]
Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley:
Harry's best friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family. A fan of the series, Grint decided he would be perfect for the part ""because [he has] ginger hair"".[9] Having seen a Newsround report about the open casting he sent in a video of himself rapping about how he wished to receive the part. His attempt was successful as the casting team asked for a meeting with him.[9]
Emma Watson as Hermione Granger:
Harry's other best friend and the trio's brains. Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents and she had to do over five interviews before she got the part.[11] Watson took her audition seriously, but ""never really thought [she] had any chance of getting the role.""[9] The producers were impressed by Watson's self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied.[12]
John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick: The ghost of Gryffindor House.[13]
Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid:
A half-giant and Hogwarts' gamekeeper. Coltrane was one of the two actors Rowling wanted most, along with Smith as McGonagall.[14][15] Coltrane, who was already a fan of the books, prepared for the role by discussing Hagrid's past and future with Rowling.[16][17]
Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick: The Charms Master and head of Ravenclaw House.[18] Davis also plays two other roles in the film: the Goblin Head Teller at Gringotts,[19] and dubs the voice of Griphook, who is embodied by Verne Troyer.[20]
Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley: Harry's Muggle uncle.[19]
Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore: Hogwarts' Headmaster and one of the most famous and powerful wizards of all time. Harris initially rejected the role, only to reverse his decision after his granddaughter stated she would never speak to him again if he did not take it.[21][22][23]
Ian Hart as Quirinus Quirrell:
The stuttering Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.[19] Hart also voiced Lord Voldemort,[24] while Richard Bremmer provided his physical appearance and portrayed him as a hooded figure during a flashback.[24][25]
John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander: a highly regarded wandmaker and the owner of Ollivanders.[19]
Alan Rickman as Severus Snape: The Potions Master and head of Slytherin House.
Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley: Harry's Muggle aunt.[19]
Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall: The Deputy Headmistress, head of Gryffindor and transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts. Smith was one of the two actors Rowling wanted most, along with Coltrane as Hagrid.[14]
Julie Walters as Molly Weasley: Ron's mother. She shows Harry how to get to Platform 9+3⁄4.[26]
Additionally, Zoë Wanamaker appears as Madame Hooch, Hogwarts' flying instructor and Quidditch referee;[27] Tom Felton portrays Draco Malfoy, a student in Slytherin and Harry's rival.[28] Harry Melling plays Dudley Dursley, Harry's cousin; and David Bradley appears as Argus Filch, Hogwarts' caretaker.[29] Matthew Lewis, Devon Murray and Alfred Enoch portray Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas respectively, three first year students in Gryffindor;[30] James and Oliver Phelps play twins Fred and George Weasley, Ron's brothers,[31] while Chris Rankin appears as his other brother Percy, a Gryffindor prefect,[32] and Bonnie Wright appears as Ron's sister Ginny.[33] Sean Biggerstaff portrays Oliver Wood, the Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team;[34] Jamie Waylett and Joshua Herdman play Crabbe and Goyle, Malfoy's minions;[35] and Leslie Phillips voices the Sorting Hat.[36] Derek Deadman plays Tom, innkeeper of The Leaky Cauldron;[37] and Elizabeth Spriggs appears as the Fat Lady, a painting at Hogwarts.[38]

Production
Development
In 1997, producer David Heyman searched for a children's book that could be adapted into a well-received film.[39] He had planned to produce Diana Wynne Jones' novel The Ogre Downstairs, but his plans fell through. His staff at Heyday Films then suggested Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which his assistant believed was ""a cool idea.""[39] Heyman pitched the idea to Warner Bros.[40] and in 1999, Rowling sold the company the rights to the first four Harry Potter books for a reported £1 million.[41] A demand Rowling made was for Heyman to keep the cast strictly British and Irish; the latter's case has Richard Harris as Dumbledore and Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, and not to cast foreign actors unless absolutely necessary, like casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) where characters from the book are specified as such.[42] Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she ""didn't want to give them control over the rest of the story"" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.[43]

Although Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the film, he declined the offer.[44] Spielberg reportedly wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment to provide Harry Potter's voice,[45] or a film that incorporated elements from subsequent books as well.[46] Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, it was like ""shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There's no challenge.""[47] Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films and that ""[a]nyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' [sic] him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.""[48] Heyman recalled that Spielberg decided to direct A.I. Artificial Intelligence instead.[46]

""Harry Potter is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime. Since the books have generated such a passionate following across the world, it was important to us to find a director that has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more ideally suited for this job than Chris.""

—Lorenzo di Bonaventura[49]
After Spielberg left, talks began with other directors, including Chris Columbus, Terry Gilliam, Jonathan Demme, Mike Newell (who would later direct the fourth film), Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Ivan Reitman, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, M. Night Shyamalan and Peter Weir.[46][50][51] Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000,[52] and the choice was narrowed down to Silberling, Columbus, Parker and Gilliam.[53] Rowling's first choice director was Terry Gilliam,[54] but Warner Bros. chose Columbus, citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone (1990) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) as influences for their decision.[49] Columbus had become a fan of the book series after his daughter persuaded him to read the first three books, leading him to call his agent to arrange a meeting at Warner Bros. to direct the film. When his agent told him that at least 25 other directors were eager to helm the project, Columbus requested his agent to secure his meeting to be the last one so he could give a ""lasting impression"" and be the studio's ""freshest person in their memory"". During two weeks of waiting, Columbus wrote a 130-page director's version of the screenplay to explain his vision for the film's tone. The day of his meeting with Warner Bros. executives including Alan F. Horn, Columbus delivered an ""impassioned 45-minute talk"" and showed them his annotated script. Weeks later, the studio notified Columbus that he had gotten the job and sent him to Scotland to meet with Rowling and Heyman.[55] Columbus pitched his vision of the film for two hours, stating that he wanted the Muggle scenes ""to be bleak and dreary"" but those set in the wizarding world ""to be steeped in color, mood, and detail."" He took inspiration from David Lean's adaptations of Great Expectations (1946) and Oliver Twist (1948), wishing to use ""that sort of darkness, that sort of edge, that quality to the cinematography,"" while being further inspired by the colour designs from Oliver! (1968) and The Godfather (1972).[46]

Steve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as ""tough"", as it did not ""lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books.""[56] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he ""almost never read"", but Harry Potter jumped out at him.[40] He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series.[56] When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters.[56] Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to ""[destroy] her baby.""[40] Rowling admitted that she ""was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves,"" but recalled her initial meeting with him: ""The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted.""[40] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.

Warner Bros. had initially planned to release the film over 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several proposed directors pulled themselves out of the running. Due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.[57]

Casting
Rowling insisted that the cast be kept British.[42] Susie Figgis was appointed as casting director, working with both Columbus and Rowling in auditioning the lead roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione.[58] Open casting calls were held for the main three roles,[59] with only British children being considered.[60] The principal auditions took place in three parts, with those auditioning having to read a page from the novel, then to improvise a scene of the students' arrival at Hogwarts, and finally to read several pages from the script in front of Columbus.[60] Scenes from Columbus' script for the Young Sherlock Holmes (1985) were also used in auditions.[61] On 11 July 2000, Figgis left the production, complaining that Columbus did not consider any of the thousands of children they had auditioned ""worthy"".[61] By August 2000, Alan Rickman and Richard Harris were in final talks to play Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore, respectively,[62] and were confirmed later that month. Tim Roth was the original choice for Snape, but he turned it down for Planet of the Apes.[63][8] On 14 August 2000, Rowling's favourites Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane were cast as Minerva McGonagall and Rubeus Hagrid. According to Figgis, Robin Williams was interested in participating in the film, but was turned down for the Hagrid role because of the ""strictly British and Irish only"" rule which Columbus was determined to maintain.[15][64][14] On 21 August 2000, Daniel Radcliffe and newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were selected to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively. Tom Felton, Liam Aiken, and William Moseley, who was later cast as Peter Pevensie in The Chronicles of Narnia series, also auditioned for Harry Potter.[65][66] Hatty Jones, who starred in the lead role in Madeline (1998), was considered for the role of Hermione Granger and had auditioned alongside Watson; she was later deemed outgrown.[67] Thomas Brodie-Sangster auditioned for Ron Weasley, but was rejected.[68][69][70] In November 2000, Julie Walters and John Cleese joined the cast as Molly Weasley and Nearly-Headless Nick, respectively.[26][71] David Thewlis auditioned for Quirrell; he would later be cast as Remus Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.[72] J. K. Rowling, the author of the books, was considered for Lily Evans; Harry's mother, but she turned down the role and Geraldine Somerville was cast.[73]

Filming
A large castle, with a ditch and trees in front of it.
Alnwick Castle in Northumberland was used as a principal filming location for Hogwarts.
Two British film industry officials requested that the film be shot in the United Kingdom, offering their assistance in securing filming locations, the use of Leavesden Film Studios, as well as changing the UK's child labour laws (adding a small number of working hours per week and making the timing of on-set classes more flexible).[46] Warner Bros. accepted their proposal. Principal photography began on 29 September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios.[74] Filming at the North Yorkshire's Goathland railway station took place on 2 October 2000.[75] Canterbury Cathedral and Scotland's Inverailort Castle were both touted as possible locations for Hogwarts; Canterbury rejected Warner Bros. proposal due to concerns about the film's ""pagan"" theme.[76][77] Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral were eventually selected as the principal locations for Hogwarts,[6] with some scenes also being filmed at Harrow School.[78] Other Hogwarts scenes were filmed in Durham Cathedral over a two-week period;[79] these included shots of the corridors and some classroom scenes.[80] Oxford University's Divinity School served as the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, and Duke Humfrey's Library, part of the Bodleian, was used as the Hogwarts Library.[81] Filming for Privet Drive took place on Picket Post Close in Bracknell, Berkshire.[79] Filming in the street took two days instead of the planned single day, so payments to the street's residents were correspondingly increased.[79] For all the subsequent film's scenes set in Privet Drive, filming took place on a constructed set in Leavesden Film Studios, which proved to be cheaper than filming on location.[82] London's Australia House was selected as the location for Gringotts Wizarding Bank,[6] while Christ Church, Oxford, was the location for the Hogwarts trophy room.[36] London Zoo was used as the location for the scene in which Harry accidentally sets a snake on Dudley,[36] with King's Cross Station also being used as the book specifies.[83] Filming concluded on 23 March 2001, with final work being done in July 2001.[50][84][74]

A building painted blue, with a sign reading ""The Glass House"". An advertisement on glasses is affixed on the door.
The store in London used as the exterior of The Leaky Cauldron.
Because the American title was different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be shot twice, once with the actors saying ""philosopher's"" and once with ""sorcerer's"".[50] The children filmed for four hours and then did three hours of schoolwork. They developed a liking for fake facial injuries from the makeup staff. Radcliffe was initially meant to wear green contact lenses as his eyes are blue, and not green like Harry's, but the lenses gave Radcliffe extreme irritation. Upon consultation with Rowling, it was agreed that Harry could have blue eyes.[85]

The steam engine used in the film as the Hogwards Express was GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall, but it was originally not the first locomotive to be selected as the Hogwarts Express. To promote the books, the Southern Railway locomotive 34027 Taw Valley was repainted and renamed temporarily, but was rejected by director Chris Columbus as looking 'too modern' for the film.[86][87]

Design and special effects
Judianna Makovsky served as the costume designer. She re-designed the Quidditch robes, having initially planned to use those shown on the cover of the American book, but deemed them ""a mess."" Instead, she dressed the Quidditch players in ""preppie sweaters, 19th-century fencing breeches and arm guards.""[88] Production designer Stuart Craig built the sets at Leavesden Studios, including Hogwarts Great Hall, basing it on many English cathedrals. Although originally asked to use an existing old street to film the Diagon Alley scenes, Craig decided to build his own set, comprising Tudor, Georgian and Queen Anne architecture.[88]

Columbus originally planned to use both animatronics and CGI animation to create the magical creatures, including Fluffy.[58] Nick Dudman, who worked on Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, was given the task of creating the needed prosthetics, with Jim Henson's Creature Shop providing creature effects.[89] John Coppinger stated that the magical creatures that needed to be created had to be designed multiple times.[90] The film features nearly 600 special effects shots, involving numerous companies. Industrial Light & Magic created Lord Voldemort's face on the back of Quirrell, Rhythm & Hues animated Norbert (Hagrid's baby dragon); and Sony Pictures Imageworks produced the Quidditch scenes.[91]

Music

John Williams composed the film's score.
Main article: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (soundtrack)
John Williams was selected to compose the score, having previously collaborated with Chris Columbus for Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.[92] Williams composed the score at his homes in Los Angeles and Tanglewood before recording it in London in September 2001. One of the main themes is entitled ""Hedwig's Theme""; Williams retained it for his finished score as ""everyone seemed to like it,"" and it became a recurring theme throughout the series.[93] James Horner was the first choice to compose the score but turned it down.[94] The soundtrack album was released on 30 October 2001 in CD format.[93]

Differences from the book
Columbus repeatedly checked with Rowling to make sure he was getting minor details correct.[89] Kloves described the film as being ""really faithful"" to the book. He added dialogue, of which Rowling approved. One of the lines originally included had to be removed after Rowling told him that it would directly contradict an event in the then-unreleased fifth Harry Potter novel Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.[95]

Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, most prominently Peeves the poltergeist. Actor Rik Mayall was cast in the role, but his scenes were ultimately cut from the film and never released. The book's first chapter, told from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley, is absent from the film. Harry and Draco's first encounter in Madam Malkin's robe shop and the midnight duel are not in the film. In the film, the responsibility of taking Norbert away is given to Dumbledore, while in the book, Harry and Hermione have to bring him by hand to Charlie Weasley's friends.[96] This necessitated a change in the detention plotline: in the book, Filch catches Harry and Hermione leaving the Astronomy Tower and puts them in detention with Neville and Malfoy, while in the film, all three protagonists receive detention after Malfoy finds them in Hagrid's hut after hours.[96] According to Kloves, this was ""the one part of the book that [Rowling] felt easily could be changed"".[88] The Quidditch pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers.[88]

The book's timeline is not enforced in the film. In the book, Harry's eleventh birthday is in 1991.[97] On the film set for 4 Privet Drive, Dudley's certificates from primary school bear the year 2001.[98]

Distribution
Marketing
The first teaser poster of the film was released on 1 December 2000.[99] The first teaser trailer was released via satellite on 2 March 2001 and debuted in cinemas with the release of See Spot Run.[100] A video game based on the film was released on 15 November 2001 by Electronic Arts for several consoles.[93] A port for the game, for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, was released in 2003.[101] Mattel won the rights to produce toys based on the film, to be sold exclusively through Warner Brothers' stores.[102] Hasbro also produced products, including confectionery products based on those from the series.[103] Warner Bros. signed a deal worth US$150 million with Coca-Cola to promote the film,[83] although some pegged the deal at $40 million-$50 million worldwide for the movie.[104] Lego produced a series of sets based on buildings and scenes from the film, as well as a Lego Creator video game.[105]

Theatrical release
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 4 November 2001, with the cinema arranged to resemble Hogwarts School.[106]

The film had previews in the United Kingdom on 1,137 screens at 491 theatres on 10 and 11 November 2001.[107] It officially opened on 16 November 2001 on 1,168 screens at 507 theatres in the United Kingdom and Ireland; in 3,672 theatres in the United States and Canada. It was the widest release at the time in the United Kingdom and the United States.[108][109]

Home media
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was first released on VHS and DVD on 11 May 2002 in the United Kingdom[110] and 28 May 2002 in the United States.[111] Between May and June 2002, the film sold 10 million copies, almost 60% of which were DVD sales.[112] It would go on to make $19.1 million in rentals, surpassing The Fast and the Furious for having the largest DVD rentals.[113] This record was surpassed by The Bourne Identity in January 2003.[114]

In December 2009, a 4-disc ""Ultimate Edition"" was released, with seven minutes of deleted scenes added back in, the feature-length special Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 1: The Magic Begins, and a 48-page hardcover booklet.[115] The extended version has a running time of about 159 minutes, which had previously been shown during certain television airings.[116] The film was re-released on DVD as part of the 8-disc Harry Potter: The Complete 8-Film Collection in November 2011,[117] and on Blu-ray as part of the 31-disc Hogwarts Collection in April 2014.[118] It was released on 4K Blu-ray as part of the 16-disc Harry Potter: 8-Film Collection in November 2017.[119]

Reception
Box office
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone grossed a record single day gross of £3.6 million during the first day of previews, beating Toy Story 2's record. It grossed a record £3.1 million for a Sunday, bringing its total to £6.7 million from the previews.[107][120] It broke the record for the highest-opening weekend ever, both including and excluding previews, making £16.3 million with and £9.6 million without previews ($13.8 million), setting a further record single day gross on the Saturday with £3.99 million.[121][122][120] It set another Sunday record with a gross of £3.6 million.[122] It had a record second weekend of £8.4 million.[123][120] It remained at number one in the UK for five weeks.[120] The film went on to make £66.1 million in the UK alone, making it the country's second-highest-grossing film of all-time (after Titanic), until it was surpassed by Mamma Mia!.[124]

In the United States and Canada, it made $32.3 million on its opening day, breaking the single-day record previously held by Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999).[125] On the second day of release, the film's gross increased to $33.5 million, breaking the record for biggest single day again. It made $90.3 million during its first weekend, breaking the record for highest-opening weekend of all time that was previously held by The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997).[126] It held the record until the following May when Spider-Man (2002) made $114.8 million in its opening weekend.[127] Plus, the film broke Batman Forever's record for having the largest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film.[128] It would hold this record for two years until it was surpassed by The Matrix Reloaded (2003).[129] Additionally, it shattered other opening records, surpassing Monsters, Inc. for having the biggest November opening weekend, Planet of the Apes for having the largest non-holiday opening weekend, the highest Friday gross and the biggest opening weekend of the year, The Mummy Returns for scoring the highest Saturday gross, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) for having the highest opening weekend for a Chris Columbus film and Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) for having the largest number of screenings, playing at 3,672 theaters.[130] In just five days, it became the fastest film to approach the $100 million mark.[131] The film grossed $2.3 million in its first two days in Taiwan,[108] giving it a worldwide opening weekend total of $107 million. The film held onto the number 1 spot at the US box office for three consecutive weekends before getting overtaken by Ocean's Eleven.[132][133][134] The film also had the highest-grossing 5-day (Wednesday-Sunday) Thanksgiving weekend record of $82.4 million, holding the title for twelve years until both The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) and Frozen (2013) surpassed it with $110.1 million and $94 million respectively.[135] By Christmas, it went on to become the highest-grossing film of the year, dethroning Shrek.[136]

Similar results were achieved across the world. A week after opening in the United States, the film added 15 additional markets and set an opening week record in Germany, grossing $18.7 million. It also set opening records in Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and German-speaking Switzerland.[123] In the following weekend, after expanding to 31 countries, the film set a record overseas weekend gross of $60.9 million, including record openings in Australia, Greece, Israel, Japan ($12.5 million), New Zealand and Spain.[137] It set another overseas weekend record with $62.3 million from 37 countries the following weekend, including record openings in France, Italy and French-speaking Switzerland.[138] The international opening weekend record would be held until it was given to Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) a year later.[139] During its theatrical run, the film earned $974 million at the worldwide box office, $317 million of that in the US and $657 million elsewhere,[5] which made it the second-highest-grossing film in history at the time,[140] as well as the year's highest-grossing film.[141] In addition, the film defeated Twister (1996) to become the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time.[142] It is the second-highest-grossing Harry Potter film after Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[143] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 55.9 million tickets in the US and Canada.[144]

In August 2020, The Philosopher's Stone was re-released in several countries, including a 4K 3D restoration in China,[145] where it earned $26.4 million, for a global $1.017 billion, making it the second film in the series to surpass the billion-dollar mark, after Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[5]

Critical response
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 200 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone adapts its source material faithfully while condensing the novel's overstuffed narrative into an involving – and often downright exciting – big-screen magical caper.""[146] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[147] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.[148]

Roger Ebert called Philosopher's Stone ""a classic,"" giving the film four out of four stars, and particularly praising the Quidditch scenes' visual effects.[149] Praise was echoed by both The Telegraph and Empire reviewers, with Alan Morrison of the latter naming it the film's ""stand-out sequence"".[150][151] Brian Linder of IGN also gave the film a positive review, but concluded that it ""isn't perfect, but for me it's a nice supplement to a book series that I love"".[31] Although criticising the final half-hour, Jeanne Aufmuth of Palo Alto Online stated that the film would ""enchant even the most cynical of moviegoers.""[152] USA Today reviewer Claudia Puig gave the film three out of four stars, especially praising the set design and Robbie Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid, but criticised John Williams' score and concluded ""ultimately many of the book's readers may wish for a more magical incarnation.""[153] The sets, design, cinematography, effects and principal cast were all given praise from Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter, although he deemed John Williams' score ""a great clanging, banging music box that simply will not shut up.""[154] Todd McCarthy of Variety compared the film positively with Gone with the Wind and put ""The script is faithful, the actors are just right, the sets, costumes, makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine.""[19] Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post recalled that the film was ""remarkably faithful,"" to its literary counterpart as well as a ""consistently entertaining if overlong adaptation.""[155]

Richard Corliss, of Time magazine, considered the film a ""by the numbers adaptation,"" criticising the pace and the ""charisma-free"" lead actors.[156] CNN's Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves ""are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative is more like a jamboree inside Rowling's head.""[157] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography ""bland and muggy,"" and the majority of the film a ""solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo.""[158] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times was highly negative about the film, saying ""[the film] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve."" He also said it suffered from ""a lack of imagination"" and wooden characters, adding, ""The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie.""[29]

Accolades
Philosopher's Stone received three Academy Award nominations: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score for John Williams.[159] The film was also nominated for seven BAFTA Awards: Best British Film, Best Supporting Actor for Robbie Coltrane, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hair, Best Sound, and Best Visual Effects.[160] It won a Saturn Award for Best Costume, and was nominated for eight more awards.[161] It won other awards from the Casting Society of America and the Costume Designers Guild.[162][163] It was nominated for the AFI Film Award for its special effects,[164] and the Art Directors Guild Award for its production design.[165] It received the Broadcast Film Critics Award for Best Family Film, and was nominated for Best Child Performance (for Daniel Radcliffe) and Best Composer.[166] In 2005, the American Film Institute nominated the film for AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores.[167]

The Last Waltz was a concert by the Canadian-American rock group The Band, held on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, at Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. The Last Waltz was advertised as The Band's ""farewell concert appearance"",[2] and the concert had The Band joined by more than a dozen special guests, including their previous employers Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan, as well as Paul Butterfield, Bobby Charles, Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond, Emmylou Harris, Dr. John, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Ronnie Wood, and Neil Young. The musical director for the concert was The Band's original record producer, John Simon.
The concert was produced and managed by Bill Graham and was filmed by director Martin Scorsese, who made it into a documentary of the same title, released in 1978. Jonathan Taplin, who was The Band's tour manager from 1969 to 1972 and later produced Scorsese's film Mean Streets, suggested that Scorsese would be the ideal director for the project, and Rock Brynner introduced Robbie Robertson and Scorsese. Taplin served as executive producer. The film features concert performances, intermittent song renditions shot on a studio soundstage, and interviews by Scorsese with members of The Band. The soundtrack and DVD were later released.
The Last Waltz is hailed as one of the greatest documentary concert films ever made. In 2019, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[3][4][5]


Plot[edit]
Beginning with a title card saying, ""This film should be played loud!"" the concert documentary covers The Band's influences and career. The group consisted of Rick Danko on bass, violin, and vocals, Levon Helm on drums, mandolin, and vocals, Garth Hudson on keyboards, saxophone and accordion, songwriter Richard Manuel on keyboards, drums, percussion and vocals, and guitarist-songwriter Robbie Robertson on vocals.

The Band, with Bob Dylan and guests, during ""I Shall Be Released""
Various other artists perform with The Band: Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Dr. John, Neil Diamond, and Eric Clapton. Genres covered include blues, rock and roll, New Orleans R&B, Tin Pan Alley pop, folk, and rock. Further genres are explored in segments filmed later on a sound stage with Emmylou Harris (country) and the Staple Singers (soul and gospel).
The film begins with The Band performing the last song of the evening, their cover version of the Marvin Gaye hit ""Don't Do It"", as an encore. The film then flashes back to the beginning of the concert, and follows it more or less chronologically. The Band is backed by a large horn section and performs many of its hit songs, including ""Up on Cripple Creek"", ""Stage Fright"", and ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"".
The live songs are interspersed with studio segments and interviews conducted by director Martin Scorsese in which the Band's members reminisce about the group's history. Robertson talks about Hudson joining the band on the condition that the other members pay him $10 a week each for music lessons. The classically trained Hudson could then tell his parents that he was a music teacher instead of merely a rock-and-roll musician. Robertson also describes the surreal experience of playing in a burnt-out nightclub owned by Jack Ruby.
Manuel recalls that some of the early names for The Band included ""The Honkies"", and ""The Crackers"". Because they were simply referred to as ""the band"" by Dylan and their friends and neighbors in Woodstock, New York, they figured that was just what they would call themselves.
Danko is seen giving Scorsese a tour of The Band's Shangri-La studio, and he plays a recording of ""Sip the Wine"", a track from his then-forthcoming 1977 solo album Rick Danko.
A recurring theme brought up in the interviews with Robertson is that the concert marks an end of an era for The Band, that after 16 years on the road, the time had come for a change. ""That's what The Last Waltz is - 16 years on the road. The numbers start to scare you,"" Robertson tells Scorsese. ""I mean, I couldn't live with 20 years on the road. I don't think I could even discuss it.""[6]

Origins[edit]
The idea for a farewell concert came about early in 1976 after Richard Manuel was seriously injured in a boating accident. Robbie Robertson then began giving thought to leaving the road, envisioning The Band becoming a studio-only band, similar to the Beatles' decision to stop playing live shows in 1966.[7] He was also concerned about the negative effects of being on the road too long:

I had become suspicious of the road. Look at what happened to this guy. Look at what happened to them. These people who got crazy when they got on the road. This was not a healthy thing. I was telling the guys in The Band, ""I like the music we make together. But I don't want to go out there with it anymore. . . . We're not learning from it. We're not growing from it.[8]
Though the other band members did not agree with Robertson's decision, the concert was set at Bill Graham's Winterland Ballroom, where The Band had made its debut as a group in 1969.[9] Originally, The Band was to perform on its own, but then the notion of inviting Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan was hatched and the guest list grew to include other performers. Robertson wanted to invite people who had been a strong influence on their music, people who represented various music styles, including New Orleans rock and roll, English blues, and Chicago blues.[8] When he called Bill Graham, he said he wanted the concert to be a kind of celebration, the end of a chapter.[8]
With only six weeks before the planned date, Robertson called director Martin Scorsese, who he knew loved rock music and had worked at the Woodstock Festival, to see if he would direct it as a concert documentary. When he mentioned some of the performers they had lined up, Scorsese reacted quickly:  ""Van Morrison? Are you kidding? I have to do it. I don't have a choice.""[8] The group promoted the concert by appearing on the October 30 episode of Saturday Night Live, where host Buck Henry introduced them by saying they were about to disband on Thanksgiving. They went into a set of ""Life Is a Carnival"" and ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" (which featured a photo montage of the Band throughout their career) both sung by Helm, Danko then sang ""Stage Fright"" and closed out the episode with a cover of ""Georgia on My Mind"" with Manuel on lead vocals.

Concert[edit]
Promoted and organized by Bill Graham, whose home turf was Winterland and who had a long association with The Band, the concert was an elaborate affair, with over 300 workers. Starting at 5:00 pm, the audience of 5,000 was served turkey dinners. There was ballroom dancing, with music by the Berkeley Promenade Orchestra. Poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Lenore Kandel, Diane di Prima, Michael McClure, Robert Duncan, and Freewheelin' Frank gave readings.[8]

The Band's drummer and vocalist Levon Helm
The Band started its concert at around 9:00 pm, opening with ""Up on Cripple Creek"". This was followed by eleven more of The Band's most popular songs, including ""The Shape I'm In"", ""This Wheel's on Fire"", and ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"". They were backed by a large horn section with charts arranged by Allen Toussaint and other musicians.
They were then joined by a succession of guest artists, starting with Ronnie Hawkins. As the Hawks, The Band served as Hawkins' backing band in the early 1960s. Dr. John took a seat at the piano for his signature song, ""Such a Night"". He then switched to guitar and joined Bobby Charles on ""Down South in New Orleans"".
A blues set was next with harmonica player Paul Butterfield, Muddy Waters, pianist Pinetop Perkins, and Eric Clapton. As Clapton was taking his first solo on ""Further on Up the Road"", his guitar strap came loose and Robertson picked up the solo without missing a beat.
Neil Young followed, singing ""Helpless"" with backing vocals by Joni Mitchell, who remained off stage. According to Robertson's commentary on The Last Waltz DVD, this was so her later appearance in the show would have more of an impact. Mitchell came on after Young and sang three songs, two with the backing of Dr. John on congas.
Neil Diamond was next, introducing his ""Dry Your Eyes"" by saying, ""I'm only gonna do one song, but I'm gonna do it good."" Robertson had produced Diamond's album Beautiful Noise the same year and co-wrote ""Dry Your Eyes"", which during the concert he hailed as a ""great song"".[10]
Van Morrison then performed two songs, a special arrangement of ""Tura Lura Lural (That's an Irish Lullaby)"" as a duet with Richard Manuel and his own show-stopper, ""Caravan"".

Bluesman Muddy Waters guested with The Band for the concert.
Canadians Young and Mitchell were then invited back out to help the Band perform ""Acadian Driftwood"", an ode to the Acadians of Canadian history. The Band then performed a short set of some more of its songs before Bob Dylan came on stage to lead his former backing band through four songs.
The Band and all its guests, with the addition of Ringo Starr on drums and Ronnie Wood on guitar, then sang ""I Shall Be Released"" as a closing number. Dylan, who wrote the song, and Manuel, whose falsetto rendition had made the song famous on Music from Big Pink, shared lead vocals, although Manuel cannot be clearly seen in the film and switched between his normal and falsetto voices between verses.
Two loose jam sessions then formed. ""Jam #1"" featured the Band minus Richard Manuel playing with Neil Young, Ronnie Wood, and Eric Clapton on guitar, Dr. John on piano, Paul Butterfield on harmonica, and Ringo Starr on drums. It was followed by ""Jam #2"" with the same personnel minus Robertson and Danko. Stephen Stills, who showed up late, took a guitar solo and Carl Radle joined on bass.
The Band then came out at around 2:15 am to perform an encore, ""Don't Do It"". It was the last time the group performed under the name ""The Band"" with its classic lineup. The five joined on stage at a Rick Danko concert in 1978. The Band reformed without Robertson in 1980 and headlined at The Roxy in Los Angeles with Scottish group Blue supporting, guests were Dr. John and Joe Cocker. Rick Danko later performed at various Los Angeles venues along with Blue, and at his invitation, they recorded their LA Sessions album at Shangri-La Studios.

Film production[edit]
Concert filming[edit]
Robertson initially wanted to record the concert on 16 mm film.[11] He recruited Martin Scorsese to direct based on his use of music in Mean Streets. Under Scorsese, the film grew into a full-scale studio production with seven 35 mm cameras.
The cameras were operated by several cinematographers, including Michael Chapman (Raging Bull), Vilmos Zsigmond (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), and László Kovács (Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces). The stage and lighting were designed by Boris Leven, who had been the production designer on such musical films as West Side Story and The Sound of Music. With Bill Graham's assistance, the set from the San Francisco Opera's production of La traviata was rented as a backdrop for the stage. Crystal chandeliers were also hung over the stage.
John Simon, who ran the rehearsals for the show, would give Scorsese details as to who sang what and who soloed when for each song. Scorsese meticulously storyboarded the songs, setting up lighting and camera cues to fit the lyrics of the songs. But despite his planning, in the rigors of the live concert setting, with the loud rock music and the hours spent filming the show, there were unscripted film reloads and camera malfunctions. It was not possible for all songs to be covered. At one point, all the cameras, except László Kovács', were shut down for a scheduled film reload as Muddy Waters was to perform ""Mannish Boy"".[11] Kovács, frustrated by Scorsese's constant instructions, had removed his headset earlier in the evening and had not heard the orders to stop filming.[12] As Scorsese frantically tried to get other cameras up, Kovács was already rolling and able to capture the iconic song by the blues legend. ""It was just luck,"" Scorsese recalled in the DVD documentary, The Last Waltz Revisited.[11]
Notably omitted from the film is Stephen Stills, who only performed in a jam session. Also omitted were performances by poets Lenore Kandel, Robert Duncan, Freewheelin' Frank Reynolds, Emmett Grogan, Diane DiPrima and Sweet William. Both jam sessions were omitted from the film entirely.

Unexpected negotiations with Dylan[edit]
Dylan and the Band, 1974
While Bob Dylan had agreed to perform at the concert, which was being filmed, he decided during the intermission that he did not want his own performance filmed after all. He feared it might detract from his film Renaldo and Clara, which he directed during the Rolling Thunder Revue tour, which ended months earlier.[13] However, Warner Bros. had agreed to finance Last Waltz only if Dylan would appear in it.
Levon Helm said that Scorsese ""went nuts"" upon hearing that Dylan changed his mind, while ""Robbie became totally pale.""[14] More than a million dollars would have been lost without Dylan's performance in the film, said Helm.[14] Jonathan Taplin, the Band's manager and producer of the film, was also beside himself, knowing that he had no influence over Dylan. He, along with Robertson and Scorsese, then went to Graham: ""Bill, you're going to have to go and talk to Bob.""[8] They knew that Graham had worked with Dylan before, such as during Graham's SNACK Benefit Concert a year earlier. They wanted Graham to explain to Dylan how dire the situation was, said Helm.[14]
As Graham walked toward Dylan's dressing room, he tried to reassure them, ""Don't worry, I'm gonna make it happen.""[14] As they waited, there were frantic backstage negotiations between Graham and Dylan, recalls Helm:[15]

Man, they were all biting their nails. I think Bill really pleaded with Bob for us, for the sake of the history of it all. He was in there for a couple of minutes, but it seemed like an hour. No one could believe this. With about five minutes left, word came down that the last two songs in Bob's part of the show could be filmed, and only the last two. Bill Graham saved their asses that night.[14][16]
Robertson also assured Dylan that the concert film's release would be delayed until after his film.[8] Taplin later said that ""Bill did the greatest thing that night. In a sense, he really saved the day for us.""[8]
At one point during Dylan's performance, Robertson states that Lou Kemp, a close friend of Dylan, said ""We're not filming this."" And Bill just said, ""Get out of here, or I'll kill you.""[13] Graham told him ""This is history, don't mess with it!"" Kemp backed off.[8] To add to the confusion, Scorsese said that when Dylan got on stage, the sound was so loud he did not know what to shoot: ""Fortunately, we got our cues right and we shot the two songs that were used in the film.""[17]
According to Kemp, ""More or less, Bob got his way. I think they shot a little more than he wanted but they didn't shoot as much as they wanted. As it ended up, everybody came out whole.[8] Robertson was also satisfied:

Oh, we'll go through all this bullshit and in the end, we'll shoot it. I knew the game very well. Thank God for Bill Graham. In the end, it was shot. And it looked staggering. He looked amazing in the film, Bobby Dylan. Almost like a Christ figure. A Christ in a white hat. I mean, what more could you ask for?[8]
Drug use[edit]
Guest Neil Young at a 1976 concert in the United States.
Scorsese has said that during this period, he was using cocaine heavily.[18] Drugs were present in large quantities during the concert.[15] A smudge of cocaine on Neil Young's nose was obscured in post-production.[15][19]

Post-concert production[edit]
Following the concert, Scorsese filmed for several days on an MGM studio soundstage, with the Band, the Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris. The Band's performance of ""The Weight"" with the Staple Singers was included in the film instead of the concert version. The Band and Harris performed ""Evangeline"", which was also included in the film. Interviews with group members were conducted by Scorsese at the Band's Shangri-La Studio in Malibu, California. Additionally, Robertson composed ""The Last Waltz Suite"", parts of which were used as a film score. Finally, according to musical director John Simon, during post-production, the live recording was altered to clean up ""playing mistakes, out-of-tune singing, bad horn-balance in the remote truck. Only Levon's part was retained in its entirety.""[20]
Due to Scorsese's commitments on New York, New York and another documentary, American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince, the film's release was delayed until 1978.
During the editing process, Scorsese and Robertson became friends, and frequently collaborated on further projects, with Robertson acting as music producer and consultant on Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, The Color of Money, Casino, Gangs of New York, The Departed and Shutter Island.[21]

Reception[edit]
Critical reception[edit]


More than being a collection of impressively filmed and virtuosically mixed 'live' songs, ""The Last Waltz"" ranks as probably the finest record of a rock concert ever put on film.


Hartford Courant[22]


The film has been hailed critically, listed among the greatest concert films. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Among one of, if not the best rock movie ever made, The Last Waltz is a revealing, electrifying view of the classic band at their height.""[23] Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Wilmington calls it ""the greatest rock concert movie ever made – and maybe the best rock movie, period"".[24] Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press comments that ""This is one of the great movie experiences.""[19] Total Film considers it ""the greatest concert film ever shot"".[25] Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave it a negative review, stating that it ""articulates so little of the end-of-an-era feeling it hints at ... that it's impossible to view the Last Waltz as anything but an also-ran.""[26] However, The New York Times in 2003 placed the film on its Best 1000 Movies Ever list,[27] while Rolling Stone called it the ""Greatest Concert Movie of All Time"".[28]
Music critic Robert Christgau gives the soundtrack a ""B+"", saying ""the movie improves when you can't see it."" He praises the blues numbers by Muddy Waters and Paul Butterfield, the horn arrangements by Allen Toussaint, and the ""blistering if messy"" guitar duet by Robertson and Eric Clapton.[29] Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out of a possible four, noting that although ""the film is such a revealing document of a time"", it also suggested the musicians had reached the end of their careers.[30]

Criticism by Levon Helm[edit]
Levon Helm, in his 1993 autobiography This Wheel's on Fire, expresses serious reservations about Scorsese's handling of the film, claiming that Scorsese and Robertson (who produced the film) conspired to make the Band look like Robertson's sidemen. He states that Robertson, who is depicted singing powerful backing vocals, was actually singing into a microphone that was turned off throughout most of the concert (a typical practice during their live performances).[14]
Helm was also dissatisfied with Manuel and Hudson's minimal screen time and the fact most of the band members never received any money for the various home videos, DVDs and soundtracks released by Warner Bros. after the project.[14]

Appreciation by Robbie Robertson[edit]


We saluted one another like we had just pulled off one of the best musical celebrations in rock 'n' roll history. It really, really does not get any better than this.


Robbie Robertson[31]


Robertson said he was relieved when the concert ended, as he was constantly worried that something would go wrong, as it did when Dylan suddenly backed out of being filmed. To all the people involved, he said ""Thank God we got through it.""[8] He recalls that all the cameramen were hugging one another, feeling they had succeeded in capturing a unique rock concert on film.
He also thanked Graham for producing the concert at Winterland, where the Band had its debut in 1969:

I remember seeing Bill and I was thinking, ""God, you did it, Bill. Well, everybody did it."" But Bill did it. We did it in his home. Like, ""Whose house are we going to shoot at? Bill's house."" Because it was his house, I felt in my heart like he had really done this thing. . . He was proud of it. and I was proud of him for being proud of it.[8]
Home video releases[edit]
For the concert's 25th anniversary in 2002, the film was remastered and a new theatrical print was made for a limited release to promote the release of the DVD and four-CD box set of the film soundtrack. It opened in San Francisco's Castro Theatre,[15] with the release later expanded to 15 theaters.[32]
The DVD features a commentary track by Robertson and Scorsese, a featurette, Revisiting The Last Waltz, and a gallery of images from the concert, the studio filming and the film premiere. A bonus scene is footage of ""Jam #2"", which is cut short because they had run out of replacement sound synchronizers for the cameras after ten hours of continuous filming.
The original 2002 DVD release was packaged as a ""special edition"". In addition to the extra features on the disc, the Amaray case came in a foil-embossed cardboard sleeve, and inside was an eight-page booklet, featuring a five-page essay by Robertson entitled ""The End of a Musical Journey"". Also included was a US$5 rebate coupon for the four-CD box set. In 2005, the DVD was re-issued with different artwork and stripped of the outer foil packaging, inner booklet and coupon; the disc's contents remained unchanged.[citation needed]
In 2006, The Last Waltz was among the first eight titles released in Sony's high definition Blu-ray format.[33] The soundtracks on the Blu-ray release consist of an uncompressed 5.1 Linear PCM track, a very high fidelity format, and a standard Dolby Digital 5.1 track.
On March 29, 2022, The Criterion Collection released a new 4K digital restoration, supervised and approved by Scorsese, with Dolby Vision HDR and a 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack, supervised and approved by Robertson.[34]

Albums[edit]
Main articles: The Last Waltz (1978 album) and The Last Waltz (2002 album)
The original soundtrack album was a three-LP album released on April 16, 1978 (later as a two-disc CD). It has many songs not in the film, including ""Down South in New Orleans"" with Bobby Charles and Dr. John on guitar, ""Tura Lura Lural (That's an Irish Lullaby)"" by Van Morrison, ""Life is a Carnival"" by the Band, and ""I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)"" by Bob Dylan. John Casado designed the packaging and logotype trademark.
In 2002, a four-CD box set was released, as was a DVD-Audio edition. Robbie Robertson produced the album, remastering all the songs. The set includes 16 previously unreleased songs from the concert, as well as takes from rehearsals. Among the additions are Louis Jordan's ""Caldonia"" by Muddy Waters, the concert version of ""The Weight"", ""Jam #1"" and ""Jam #2"" in their entirety, and extended sets with Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan.
The soundtrack recordings underwent post-concert production featuring heavy use of overdubbing and re-sequencing. Bootleg collectors have circulated an original line recording of the concert as a more accurate and complete document of the event.[citation needed] It includes songs not available in the film or the official album releases, including ""Georgia on My Mind"", ""King Harvest (Has Surely Come)"", the complete ""Chest Fever"" and the live version of ""Evangeline"".[35]

As my title suggests; there's no charm to anything new the film introduces, whether that is characters, voice actors, character design or story. The fact my 6 year old loves the first film and was visibly bored through most of this speaks volumes too.The new voice actors are different to the point they essentially change the personalities of some characters and a few of the vocal performances are objectively poor and lifeless. It's unfortunate that it's two of the main characters that are impacted by this.The animation is unremarkable and the theme of a prison camp/play on The Great Escape is watered down and replaced with very little. The film does get better but is annoyingly slow to get going.helpful•3418andrewbrudenell1Dec 15, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDecember 2023 TV and Streaming Premiere DatesDecember 2023 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates""Power Book III: Raising Kanan ,"" The Family Plan, and ""Midsomer Murders"" are three of the biggest TV and streaming premieres this month.

965903047325790,2,"Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a delightful 2005 stop-motion animated film created by Aardman Animations. It follows the misadventures of eccentric inventor Wallace and his trusty canine sidekick, Gromit, as they attempt to rid their small English village of a giant, destructive rabbit that emerges at night to devour the locals' prize-winning vegetables. As Wallace and Gromit investigate the strange occurrences, they encounter a cast of colorful characters, including a neurotic vicar, a pompous rival, and a charming love interest for Wallace. The film blends witty humor, clever puns, and thrilling action sequences, all while showcasing the incredible stop-motion animation that Aardman is known for. 

It has a lot of non verbal action which will entertain the 5 year old and will also be enjoyable for you and your sister as it contains whitty and punny references for adult viewers.

Yet Pesto's technology uses LEDs, which didn't become available until the mid-70s, and diode lasers, which weren't available to the general public until about 2000. However, Wallace has been shown to be a genius inventor, it's quite possible he invented all of these things himself, long before the items became available to the public.Quotes[Quartermaine's hairpiece has been sucked up in the Bunvacc] Lord Victor Quartermaine: I want...[lowers voice] Lord Victor Quartermaine: ... toupée, please.Wallace: Oh, grand. We take cheques or cash.Lord Victor Quartermaine: Toupée, you idiot! My hair is in your machine.Wallace: Oh, no, it's only rabbits in there. The hare, I think you'll find, is a much larger mammal.Crazy creditsRabbits float up the screen during the closing credits. On the Sci-fi
music, they flash in different colors. On the romantic music, two rabbits
act romantic and sometimes fly in other directions. The final line in
the credits is ""We would like to stress that no animals were harmed during
the making of this film"", and a rabbit hits its head on the text and falls.Alternate versionsWhen it was released in the USA, Wallace's line ""How's your prize marrow of yours coming on?"" was changed to ""How's your prize melon of yours coming on?"". This is most likely due to being that marrow was a common vegetable in the UK but not in the US. Strangely, US TV broadcasts such as on Cartoon Network and WGN America keeps the original line as well as Netflix UK prints uses the US version with that edited line.ConnectionsFeatured in At the Movies: Episode #2.31 (2005)SoundtracksThe Planets Opus 32:2. Venus, The Bringer of PeacePerformed by Berliner Philharmoniker / Gustav Holst / Herbert von KarajanComposed by Gustav HolstCourtesy of The Decca Record Company LimitedLicensed by kind permission from The Film & TV Licensing Division, Part of The Universal Music GroupUser reviews360ReviewReviewFeatured review9/10 A Grand movie, and a Very Close Shave to perfection, Curse of the Were-Rabbit is totally entertaining from start to finishWallace and Gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted. The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes ""A Grand Day Out,"" ""The Wrong Trousers,"" and also ""A Close Shave"" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. Winning several Oscars and also countless other awards, Nick Park became quite the popular man in the U.K., yet his impact on the United States has not been big. After the third Wallace and Gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project.5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally hits the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. This film will be a delight for both kids and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has already perfected and DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations.Wallace and Gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. Their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of Victor. Simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons.In animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. Despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most Curse of the Were-Rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. Just picture the movie Madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.Casting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. Peter Sallis yet again does a wonderful job as Wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (The Wrong Trousers: ""It's the wrong trousers Gromit, and they've gone wrong!""). Ralph Fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit ""Fight Club"") lends her lovely voice as she plays Wallace's love interest. Even though nothing could top the final chase in ""The Wrong Trousers,"" Curse of the Ware-Rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. Whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the ""cursed"" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.Bottom Line: Despite not being as memorable as ""The Wrong Trousers"", this film is just as good and entertaining as Chicken Run. Unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. There is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. This film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-Year-Old Virgin, Wedding Crashers, and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. Highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade.

Shang-Chi was visually based on Bruce Lee so Brandon seemed a fitting choice, but the plan fell through.Goofs(at around 18 mins) It's nearly impossible for a bus to run away with its (air)brake lines cut. Instant air pressure in the brake system is the only thing keeping the massive springs in each wheel from locking the brakes.

The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but I found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless. The fight choreography was bangin', and all the action was just very well directed. Everything felt purposeful and exhilarating. The beginning of the movie feels like a straight-up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast. The music definitely felt like it added a lot here. I kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for Black Panther's soundtrack, and I honestly think this film did it even better. I think that, all in all, this is probably the best thing Marvel has produced since Endgame.helpful•249crom-dubhDec 6, 2021Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inLovable Creatures: Our Favorite Screen PalsLovable Creatures: Our Favorite Screen PalsGrogu, E.T., and more cuddly creatures we love to see on the screen.See the galleryPhotosFAQ20How long is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings?Powered by AlexaWho exactly is 'Shang-Chi'?DetailsEditRelease dateSeptember 1, 2021 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesMarvel (United States)Official FacebookLanguagesEnglishMandarinAlso known asSteamboatFilming locationsDisney Studios, Moore Park, Sydney, New South Wales, AustraliaProduction companiesWalt Disney PicturesMarvel StudiosSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$200,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$224,543,292Opening weekend US & Canada$75,388,688Sep 5, 2021Gross worldwide$432,243,292See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 12 minutesColorColorSound mixIMAX 6-TrackDolby DigitalDolby AtmosRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Christmas Movies To Stream This Holiday Season


Every December, we rearrange our schedules around gift-shopping, cookie-baking, party-going, carol-singing, and — more than ever — movie-watching. There’s a treasure trove of holiday features that make the season bright, so you’d better queue them up before the New Year rolls around, resolutions kick in, and the long wait for the next holiday season begins.

We’ve picked out 25 such films that are available to stream on Netflix, so you can watch one every single day from the first of the month all the way to the main event. (And we just might have tucked an extra surprise in there, too.) So brew up some cocoa, break out the fuzzy socks, and let the holiday season streaming start!

COURTESY OF UNIVERSAL
Love Actually
Whenever you get gloomy about the state of the world, just queue up Love Actually. Richard Curtis’ beloved 2003 film, boldly (but not wrongly) billed as “the ultimate romantic comedy,” documents a month in London before Christmas, following a large cast of characters and their tangled love stories — romantic, platonic, and familial. The all-star cast includes Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Bill Nighy, Liam Neeson, and Keira Knightley.  

Heather Graham as Charlotte, Brandy Norwood as Jackie, Madison Validum as Beatrix sit at a festive table together in ‘Best. Christmas. Ever!’
 SCOTT EVERETT WHITE/NETFLIX
Best. Christmas. Ever!
Christmas is a competitive sport in Mary Lambert’s new comedy. Heather Graham stars as a suburban mom who ends up, in a bit of comedic confusion, taking her family to spend the holiday with her longtime frenemy (Brandy), whose impeccable facade has long been a source of resentment. Tune in to find out if old tensions give way to a new understanding — or if the setup leads instead to a holiday-hostess smackdown. 

Brady Noon as Wyatt, Jennifer Garner as Jess, Ed Helms as Bill, Lincoln Alex Sykes and Theodore Brian Sykes as Baby Miles, and Emma Myers as CC stand outside looking at falling snow in ‘Family Switch’.
 COLLEEN HAYES/NETFLIX 
Family Switch  
A family of five, generationally disconnected and consumed by busy schedules, gets a powerful jolt of togetherness in McG’s new comedy, based on Amy Krouse Rosenthal’s 2010 children’s book Bedtime for Mommy. Jennifer Garner and Ed Helms star as the parents of three children (and a dog), all of whom are forced to walk in each other’s shoes — literally — when they get body-swapped just before Christmas. ’Tis the season for intensive empathy! 

Isabela Merced as Julie and Shameik Moore as Stuart Bale sled down a snowy hill together in ‘Let It Snow’
Let It Snow
Based on the YA novel of the same name by John Green, Maureen Johnson, and Lauren Myracle, Luke Snellin’s teen romantic comedy follows a large group of teenagers (including Kiernan Shipka, Isabela Merced, and Odeya Rush) on a snowy Christmas Eve. The teens’ various romantic intrigues — including one involving a pop star (Shameik Moore) passing through town — all intensify and intertwine over the course of the day in the lead-up to an epic party that night. 

 Falling for Christmas
SCOTT EVERETT WHITE/NETFLIX
Falling for Christmas
Ring in December with Falling for Christmas, which marked the triumphant return of Y2K queen Lindsay Lohan to the screen. The Parent Trap and Freaky Friday darling stars in Janeen Damian’s rom-com as a bratty heiress who loses her memory after a skiing accident. Staying in a cozy lodge while trying to figure out who she is, she forges a bond with its proprietor (Chord Overstreet) and his daughter.

 Scrooge: A Christmas Carol
 
Scrooge: A Christmas Carol
Catch Netflix’s adaptation of Charles Dickens’ iconic Christmas ghost story, an animated musical interpretation directed by Stephen Donnelly. Luke Evans provides the voice of the miserly protagonist, with Olivia Colman as the Ghost of Christmas Past, Johnny Flynn as Bob Cratchit, and Jonathan Pryce as Jacob Marley, among others. It’s no humbug, we promise!

 White Christmas
EVERETT COLLECTION
White Christmas
Two WWII-vet celebrity entertainers (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) team up with an obscure sister act (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to stage a musical in an empty Vermont hotel owned by their former commanding officer. Absolutely nothing about it ought to work, but somehow it all does! Credit the monumentally talented lead quartet, directed by Casablanca’s Michael Curtiz, for turning a plot seemingly held together by maple syrup and Christmas wishes into a holiday classic for the ages.

 A Christmas Prince
 
A Christmas Prince
Take a whole Sunday to get cozy and make your way through the entire Christmas Prince saga. The trilogy begins with Alex Zamm’s 2017 rom-com, in which an American journalist (Rose McIver) travels to the fictional country of Aldovia at Christmastime. While snooping around for a scoop, she falls in love with the Aldovian prince (Ben Lamb). Viewers fell in love, too, prompting the release of A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding in 2018 and A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby in 2019.

 Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey
GARETH GATRELL/NETFLIX
Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey
Critically acclaimed and packed with holiday magic, David E. Talbert’s musical fantasy is a Christmas journey you don’t want to miss. Forest Whitaker stars as the brilliant toymaker Jeronicus Jangle — long ruined since his traitorous apprentice (Keegan-Michael Key) stole his book of inventions. With some help from his daughter (Anika Noni Rose) and granddaughter (Madalen Mills), he strives to reclaim his legacy and feel inspired again.

 Single All the Way
PHILIPPE BOSSÉ/NETFLIX
Single All the Way
In an effort to preempt his family’s annual interrogations about his relationship status, Peter (Michael Urie) asks his best friend Nick (Philemon Chambers) to pose as his boyfriend over the holidays. What Peter doesn’t expect, though, is that his mother (Kathy Najimy) would set him up with her fitness instructor — nor that there may be more to his bond with Nick than just friendship. Also featuring Jennifer Coolidge as Peter’s eccentric aunt, Michael Mayer’s 2021 rom-com has become a holiday must-watch.

 A Castle for Christmas
MARK MAINZ/NETFLIX
A Castle for Christmas
Brooke Shields and Cary Elwes star in Mary Lambert’s cozy romantic comedy, in which a recently divorced romance novelist (Shields), under siege from her fans for killing off a beloved character, flies to Scotland to wait out the storm. Upon seeing a castle her father once knew as a child, she impulsively decides to buy it from the grumpy duke (Elwes) who calls it home. You’ll just have to watch to find out if the historic château is the only thing she falls in love with over there!

 Alien Xmas
 
Alien Xmas
Keeping Christmas earthbound is thinking small. Why not blast some holiday cheer out into the universe? For an intergalactic yuletide adventure, look to Stephen Chiodo’s short and sweet stop-motion film, in which a greedy alien race schemes to steal our planet’s possessions by disabling Earth’s gravity. But when X (Dee Bradley Baker), the extraterrestrial assigned to the mission, touches down on the North Pole, his first taste of Christmas spirit just might change his mind.

 Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square
 
Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square
You know what this Christmas could use? More Dolly Parton. Luckily, there’s Christmas on the Square for that. Directed and choreographed by Debbie Allen, the Emmy-winning musical stars Christine Baranski as a rather Scroogeish landowner planning to evict the residents of her hometown and sell the real estate to a mega-mall developer. With the guidance of a sassy Christmas angel (Parton, who also wrote all the film’s songs), she starts to reconsider her scheme — and her own history with the town.

 The Princess Switch
 
The Princess Switch
Ready for another movie marathon? Queue up Mike Rohl’s Princess Switch trilogy, in which an American pastry chef (Vanessa Hudgens) competes in a Christmas baking contest in the fictional Belgravia, where she meets the prince’s fiancée (also Hudgens) and is shocked to discover they’re seemingly identical. Who could resist such an opportunity for a quick little life swap? And then, who could resist following the look-alikes’ story further, with sequels Switched Again and Romancing the Star?

 The Knight Before Christmas
BROOKE PALMER/NETFLIX
The Knight Before Christmas
Even once you’ve watched all of the Princess Switch films, your Vanessa Hudgens holiday viewing is not complete! Monika Mitchell’s zany romantic fantasy The Knight Before Christmas stars the actor as a Midwestern high school teacher who falls in love, improbably enough, with a medieval knight (Josh Whitehouse). The knight has magically traveled through time to fulfill an unspecified cosmic quest by Christmas Eve. As one does!

 Klaus
 
Klaus
Santa gets a fresh origin story in Sergio Pablos’ holiday flick, which scored an Oscar nomination for best animated feature. J.K. Simmons provides the voice for the title character, an introverted toymaker, whose unlikely friendship with a self-centered postman (Jason Schwartzman) yields an even unlikelier project — delivering toys for local children in the middle of the night. This brings joy to a bitterly divided town in 19th-century Norway.

 Holidate
 
Holidate
Here’s a story to give hope to everyone who’s flying solo during the holidays. Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey play a pair of singles who, after a disappointing Christmas, make a pact to always be each other’s “holidates” in John Whitesell’s raunchy rom-com. Over the course of a year, they show up for each other on St. Patrick’s Day, the Fourth of July, Halloween and everything in between. But by the time December rolls around again, their feelings about their arrangement — and each other — have totally changed.

 The Noel Diary
KC BAILEY/NETFLIX
The Noel Diary
This holiday drama from Father of the Bride filmmaker Charles Shyer delivers a little bit of romance and a little bit of mystery. After the death of his mother, a successful novelist (Justin Hartley) travels to his hometown at Christmas to settle her estate. There, he meets a young woman (Barrett Doss) searching for answers about her own family history; together, they confront their pasts — and maybe find a future.

 Holiday Rush

Holiday Rush
When Rush (Romany Malco), a widowed hip-hop DJ, loses his job after his radio station transitions to pop, he and his four spoiled children are forced to move back to their old home in Leslie Small’s romantic dramedy. As Rush’s family adjusts to their new lifestyle, he and his producer Roxy (Sonequa Martin-Green) buy the small station where they got their start — and realize they might have more than professional feelings for each other.

 The Holiday Calendar
 
The Holiday Calendar
As long as we’re counting down the days to Christmas, how about a movie that does the same? Bradley Walsh’s rom-com follows two lifelong best friends (Kat Graham and Quincy Brown), both photographers, whose December reunion is mysteriously mirrored in the daily tokens offered up from an antique advent calendar. So, is the calendar magic? Will our heroes end up together? Only one way to find out!

 The Christmas Chronicles
MICHAEL GIBSON/NETFLIX
The Christmas Chronicles
Who knew that Santa Claus was the role that Kurt Russell was born to play? In Clay Kaytis’ 2018 yuletide adventure, the star brilliantly embodies a Saint Nick who –– when his sleigh is disrupted and bag of presents lost mid-Christmas Eve night –– must team up with a pair of kids to save the holiday before daybreak. In the Chris Columbus-directed sequel, Russell’s real-life partner, Goldie Hawn, takes his side as Mrs. Claus.

 Love Hard
BETTINA STRAUSS/NETFLIX
Love Hard
How about some catfishing for Christmas? Nina Dobrev stars in Hernán Jiménez’s romantic comedy as Natalie, a writer who travels cross-country to surprise Josh (Jimmy O. Yang) — whom she met via an app and has only spoken to over the phone — at Christmas, just to discover she’s been duped. Josh introduces her to his friend (Darren Barnet) whose photos he used in his profile, and after spending time with both men, Natalie realizes her true feelings.

 Christmas with You
JESSICA KOURKOUNIS/NETFLIX
Christmas with You
Rom-com icon Freddie Prinze Jr. returns to the genre in this holiday offering, directed by Gabriela Tagliavini. Aimee Garcia co-stars as an exhausted pop star whose label is demanding a holiday track before Christmas. Seeking inspiration, she travels to upstate New York to meet with a young fan, but when a snowstorm hits, she has to crash with the teenager’s family. Luckily, the girl’s widowed father (Prinze) is a songwriter, too — and it turns out they make pretty good music together.

 Christmas Inheritance
 
Christmas Inheritance
It’s a classic Christmas setup: A city-dweller gets stuck in a small town, where they’re at first frustrated and eventually charmed. In this twist on that holiday subgenre from Ernie Barbarash, Eliza Taylor plays the spoiled city girl, Ellen; her CEO father sends her to his tiny New England hometown at Christmas to test whether she’s capable of inheriting his role. There, she meets Jake (Jake Lacy) and his aunt Debbie (Andie MacDowell), whose generous influence changes her perspective.

 A Boy Called Christmas
STUDIOCANAL
A Boy Called Christmas
Christmas Eve is the perfect time to hit play on Gil Kenan’s enchanting A Boy Called Christmas. When the king (Jim Broadbent) promises a reward in exchange for a symbol of hope, young Nikolas (Henry Lawfull) tries to help his father win the prize, and finds himself on an epic quest to reach a city of magic inhabited by elves.

The land is part of a farm, which the owners allowed to be transformed into the Hobbiton set by The Lord of the Rings production crew in the late 1990s. After filming wrapped on the first trilogy, the farm's owners turned the land into a Tolkien tourism spot, offering guided tours of the Hobbiton set. With the crew from The Hobbit trilogy making improvements and additions to the aging Hobbiton set, the farm owners were happy to temporarily close down their tourism business, so filming could take place there again.GoofsEarly in the journey, as the Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf are riding in the rain, none of the characters are really wet. In the downpour, water should be streaming down Bilbo's face and off of Gandalf's hat and beard.QuotesGaladriel: Mithrandir? Why the Halfling?Gandalf: I don't know. Saruman believes that it is only great power that can hold evil in check. But that is not what I have found. I've found it is the small things, everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keeps the darkness at bay. Simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.Crazy creditsLists the publishers for all of The Hobbit in all the different languages.Alternate versionsAlso shown in a 3D and 48 fps version, but the content is the same.ConnectionsEdited into The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Extended Edition Scenes (2013)SoundtracksBlunt the KnivesLyrics by J.R.R.

This is in keeping with the character, as the only time Legolas blinks in The Lord of the Rings trilogy is when he is strongly surprised.GoofsThe movies previously retained the idea from the books that sunlight renders Orcs non-functional. Gandalf remarked in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) on how alarming it is that Saruman's breeding program has produced sun-resistant Orc soldiers. Yet in the barrel escape scene from Thranduil's caverns, the orcs are chasing the dwarfs down the River Running, and doing hard battle, in broad daylight without suffering any ill effects.QuotesBalin: [sees a chamber full of dead dwarves, with their only means of escape blocked] The last of our kin. They must have come here hoping beyond hope. We could make for the mines. Might last a few days.Thorin Oakenshield: No. I will not die like this, cowering, clawing for breath. We make for the forges.Dwalin: He'll see us! Sure as death.Thorin Oakenshield: Not if we split up.Balin: Thorin, we'll never make it.Thorin Oakenshield: Some of us might. Lead him to the forges. We kill the dragon. If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together!Alternate versionsThe Extended Edition that was made for the home theater market adds 25 minutes of additional footage. These include the following new or extended scenes:
At the Prancing Pony, Gandalf asks Thorin about his business in Bree. Thorin tells him that he is searching for Thrain, his father who was presumed dead after the Battle of Moria; Thrain has supposedly been seen again. Thorin also mentions that Thrain was wearing one of the seven Dwarf Lord rings when he disappeared.After having spent the night in Beorn's house, the Dwarves are discussing how they can get past Beorn unseen; however, Gandalf assures them they will need Beorn's help. Gandalf goes with Bilbo to carefully introduce the group to Beorn, and instructs the Dwarves come out of the house two at a time (except for Bombur who is instructed to come out alone) much to Beorn's unpleasant surprise.Upon leaving with Beorn's ponies, Beorn makes the group swear to free the horses before entering the forest. He then has a talk with Gandalf about Azog, the Necromancer at Dol Guldur, the tombs in the mountains (featuring a flashback with a voiceover by Galadriel) and a possible return of Sauron.Gandalf warns the Dwarves not to disturb the water in Mirkwood, use only bridges and be wary of illusions.The Dwarves find the bridge in Mirkwood destroyed, so they cross the river with the use of vines hanging above the water. Bombur falls in the water and is asleep, so the other Dwarves need to carry him. They see a white stag, which Thorin tries to shoot unsuccessfully. Bilbo states this will bring bad luck.The Master of Laketown and his aid Alfrid talk about Bard and their desire to get rid of his influence on the people of the town. As Alfrid serves the Master a plate of goat and ram's testicles to eat, they discuss a possibility to silence Bard.While being smuggled into Laketown, the Dwarves are discovered. They fight off the guards with the help of the townsfolk. Braga, the captain of the guards, enters, and Bard bribes him into leaving by offering him a fancy piece of underwear for his wife.The Master of Laketown and Alfrid are discussing an old prophecy that when the king of the mountain returns, the streets will run with gold.Alfrid asks whether Thorin can be trusted to keep his word, prompting Bilbo to vouch for him.The remaining Dwarves ask Alfrid to help the wounded Kili, but he coldly dismisses them.Balin describes how the desolation of Smaug was once a lush woodland.While at Dol Guldur, Gandalf is suddenly attacked by a Dwarf. After a brief scuffle, Gandalf recognizes his assailant as Thrain, and uses an enchantment to give him his memory back. Thrain mentions how he lost his finger and the Dwarf Lord ring during the Battle of Moria. He also warns Gandalf that no one should enter Erebor.Gandalf and Thrain are attacked by Azog at Dol Guldur. Azog's subtitle, ""Run him down!"" is changed to ""Run them down!"" in the Extended Edition. Gandalf fights him off and they run away, only to be caught by the Necromancer, who uses black smoke tendrils to grab and kill Thrain.ConnectionsEdited into The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Extended Edition Scenes (2014)SoundtracksTrumpet FanfareComposed by David Donaldson, David Long, Steve Roche & Janet RoddickUser reviews1KReviewReviewFeatured review7/10 The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug: Alike the first, impressive but not ground breakingThe Lord Of The Rings trilogy blew me away, they were truly outstanding masterpieces that deserved every bit of recognition they got.The Hobbit I delayed due to a laundry list of concerns, all of which are being confirmed now I'm finally getting around to them.They look beautiful, they are a lot of fun, but compared to LOTR they are alike Mythica movies.The whole franchise has become a cash grab, the Hobbit should have been one single movie and without all the excessive alterations. Yes I know LOTR had changes, but not to this devastating extent.Desolation Of Smaug certainly has it's moments, I especially enjoyed the spiders and the not so jolly romp through the cursed forest. Thankfully the film isn't as goofy as the first either which was a welcome relief.Alas it's no better, it still feels lackluster. This is The Hobbit, one of the greatest tales ever put to paper! So why do these movies feel so underwhelming? I enjoyed this I truly did, but not as much as I should have and that right there is the problem.The Good: Forest scene was great Looks stunning The Bad: As neat as the barrels scene is it's about as realistic as Tara Reeds boobs Second movie, second stock scream Things I Learnt From This Movie: Bilbo Baggins has never seen Arachnophobia (1990), don't.....pluck.....the web Walnuts make great pillowsWhatever Cumberbatch was paid it was FAR too muchhelpful•3312PlatypuschowNov 30, 2017Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ43How long is The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug?Powered by AlexaHow come Gandalf fails to escape from Dol Guldur while Radagast is successful?Why does not Smaug form an alliance with Sauron, are not both on the same side?What is 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' about?DetailsEditRelease dateDecember 11, 2013 (Netherlands)Countries of originNew ZealandUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial SiteLanguageEnglishAlso known asThe Hobbit: The Desolation of SmaugFilming locationsParadise, Glenorchy, Otago, New ZealandProduction companiesMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)New Line CinemaWingNut FilmsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$225,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$258,387,334Opening weekend US & Canada$73,645,197Dec 15, 2013Gross worldwide$959,027,992See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 41 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosDatasatDolby DigitalAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was De Hobbit: de Woestenij van Smaug (2013) officially released in Italy?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Lee was one of a handful of cast members to star in both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, and was also the only cast member of either trilogy to have met J.R.R. Tolkien.GoofsThorin and Dwalin fight off ""no more than a hundred"" goblin mercenaries at Ravenhill while Fili and Kili search for Azog. When we go back to Thorin and Dwalin, there are no signs of the dead goblins.Quotes[From trailer] Bilbo Baggins: One day I'll remember. Remember everything that happened: the good, the bad, those who survived... and those that did not.Crazy creditsThe closing credits are accompanied by sketches of people/locations from across the Hobbit trilogy.Alternate versions2015 Extended Edition Blu-ray contains twenty minutes additional footage, including more graphic violence, increasing the run-time to 164 minutes. Due to the extra amount of violence, this version has been rated R by the MPAA.ConnectionsEdited into The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Extended Edition Scenes (2015)SoundtracksThe Last GoodbyeWritten by Billy Boyd, Philippa Boyens and Fran WalshPerformed by Billy BoydUser reviews952ReviewReviewFeatured review8/10 It's still not ""Lord of the Rings,"" but this is a fitting conclusion for a perfectly good fantasy trilogyDid Peter Jackson really just conclude his second Middle Earth trilogy? His take on J.R.R. Tolkein's ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a completely exhausting adventure that in many ways feels like seven films, not three, while ""The Hobbit"" trilogy feels exactly like it is on paper: one straightforward adventure broken into three parts. ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" proves a fitting, exciting conclusion to this particular trilogy, but compared to the conclusion of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" quite frankly and pun intended – it gets dwarfed.As with ""The Unexpected Journey"" and ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" is another beautiful achievement in fantasy filmmaking, with stunning production value and an outstanding director in Jackson. It is creative, humorous, action-packed, brimming with talent and gravitas and so many of the things that made ""The Lord of the Rings"" the achievement it was. So why was this trilogy less acclaimed and somewhat anti-climactic? Part of this undoubtedly has to do with novelty. We've been to Middle Earth before, we've seen the makeup and the elaborate sets, we know how Jackson navigates a battle sequence. Although ""The Hobbit"" has new locales and new characters and was the first film series screened with a higher frame rate, it's not as groundbreaking an achievement. Also, that accomplishment set the bar high for ""The Hobbit"" given how many people have returned from ""Lord of the Rings"" on camera and off.Yet the real culprit is story. ""The Hobbit"" is a children's book, so splitting it into three parts is merely dragging out a streamlined plot of ""company seeks treasure and justice, company faces challenges along the way culminating in a mighty dragon, company overcomes odds."" The added subplots put more meat on the bones of the three films, especially ""Desolation,"" but did not necessarily add complexity or maturity to it.""Five Armies"" at least does not waste any time. The first act is entirely buildup to the titular battle with plenty of suspense as sides try to negotiate in order to prevent an unnecessary war when a much greater evil is growing in Middle Earth. After Smaug torches Lake-town, Thranduil (Lee Pace) and the Wood-elves march upon Erebor, where Thorin (Richard Armitage) has reclaimed his rightful throne. Thorin, however, is corrupted by his greed, and rather than help the displaced people of Lake-town, grows restless because his treasure's focal point, the Arkenstone, has yet to be found. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who has been hiding the Arkenstone, sees Thorin's madness could cause a senseless war, which of course it does, only the battle takes a different shape when Azog the Defiler and his orc army arrives.So corruption and selfishness become dominant themes of the film until the final battle, which doesn't disappoint in scale, entertainment, or visual effects. What it doesn't do, however, is command a vested interest from the audience. And when the larger battle halts entirely in order to follow the main characters, it hurts the larger overall narrative, or rather, calls attention to the fact that there really isn't one at this point in the story other than ""kill the orcs."" Yes, the fate of Middle Earth is at stake, but we already know how things will ultimately play out.Someone who has never seen the films watching all six in order could be something special, though. ""Five Armies"" does make ""The Hobbit"" trilogy a rather strong bridge to ""Lord of the Rings,"" even in its last shot. In a way, Jackson acknowledges that that tale is the bigger story, the one that matters most. The parting message is kind of like ""we hope you enjoyed these three fun movies, but 'The Lord of the Rings,' that's where it's really at."" As moviegoers who witnessed ""Lord of the Rings,"" this doesn't quite work for us, because we wanted to go back to Middle Earth for something more, to build on the experience of ""Lord of the Rings."" ""The Hobbit,"" however, like any good prequel, is the foundation, not the next step, and because the story is so simplistic, it doesn't quite do enough for us on its own.""The Hobbit"" is a fun, small adventure filled with courage, danger, evil and love set in the world of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and ""Five Armies"" is that big scene at the end of the story where everything comes to boil. That's the gist of it. The rest is Jackson and his extraordinary cast and crew bringing that elaborate world back to life for us to enjoy one more time.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

It hones in on the fragility of an artist and lays open wounds that are hard to witness. Natalie Portman's character is driven but vulnerable and s set up to succumb to her art. Of course, rivalry is a given, and her rival does everything she can to put the screws to her. Unfortunately, the questioning of her own talent is going to show at some point. I can't say I enjoyed this movie. I realize that obsession is often a strength with artists, but it can also be all consuming. This film is about as dark as it can be but it puts a stranglehold on the viewers.helpful•6510HitchcocMay 5, 2019Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ10What is 'Black Swan' about?Is 'Black Swan' based on a book?What is the story behind the ""Swan Lake"" ballet?DetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 3, 2011 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial FacebookLanguagesEnglishFrenchItalianAlso known asThiên Nga ĐenFilming locationsThe Concert Hall, Performing Arts Center, Purchase College, State University Of New York at Purchase, Purchase, New York, USAProduction companiesSearchlight PicturesCross Creek PicturesProtozoa PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$13,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$106,954,678Opening weekend US & Canada$1,443,809Dec 5, 2010Gross worldwide$329,398,046See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 48 minutesColorColorSound mixDolbyDTSSDDSAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the streaming release date of Black Swan (2010) in Canada?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Franklin and his team at Double Negative. Thorne provided pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the team, which then created new CGI software programs based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to one hundred hours to render, and ultimately the whole CGI program reached to eight hundred terabytes of data. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and led to him writing two scientific papers, one for the astrophysics community, and one for the computer graphics community.GoofsTwo characters sustain a fall from an ice plateau, on a steep ice ramp, onto a shadowy ice platform.

This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.ConnectionsFeatured in Trailer Failure: Interstellar (2013)SoundtracksDo Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night(uncredited)Written by Dylan ThomasUser reviews5.5KReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 Out of this worldA lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...helpful•67358kosmaspMay 31, 2015Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inExceptional Robots on Film & TVExceptional Robots on Film & TVFrom Transformers to droids and everything in between, these memorable robots made their mark on viewers.Initiate gallery viewingPhotosFAQ35How long is Interstellar?Powered by AlexaWhy did Earth change its history books to claim that the Apollo missions to the Moon were faked?How did Cooper figure out NASA's location?What were Plan A and Plan B?DetailsEditRelease dateNovember 6, 2014 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesUnited KingdomCanadaOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial TwitterLanguageEnglishAlso known asFlora's LetterFilming locationsIcelandProduction companiesParamount PicturesWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$165,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$188,020,017Opening weekend US & Canada$47,510,360Nov 9, 2014Gross worldwide$731,079,637See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 49 minutesColorColorSound mixDatasatDolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackDolby Surround 7.1Aspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

A little bit of cinema history.Last week I bought ""Now Voyager"" on DVD and was completely blown away!Perhaps it's because I know the story so well, but I was able to appreciate the movie on several different levels such as cinematography, direction and editing.Bette Davis was always the prime reason for watching but I never realized what a fine naturalistic actor Claude Raines was. His scenes with Bette Davis exude intelligence and warmth.I stopped to consider what a 2004 remake might look like - who could play the leads? Who would direct? What would the score be like?With no disrespect to anyone in the movie industry, I don't think a remake would ever be possible.The actors and technicians on this movie were truly masters of their craft.I defy anyone who watches the first ten minutes not to be hooked until the closing credits.helpful•9914brit1955Jun 12, 2004Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ25How long is Now, Voyager?Powered by AlexaWhat is 'Now, Voyager' about?Is 'Now, Voyager' based on a book?What were those terrible things that Charlotte's mother found hidden in Charlotte's bookshelves?DetailsEditRelease dateMarch 1947 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesEnglishPortugueseAlso known asNow, VoyagerFilming locationsBig Bear Lake, Big Bear Valley, San Bernardino National Forest, California, USAProduction companyWarner Bros.See more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditGross worldwide$10,390See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 57 minutesColorBlack and WhiteAspect ratio1.37 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the German language plot outline for Een vreemde passagier (1942)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Emilia Clarke's first tattoo was also a bumblebee on her finger which she got after wrapping the film.GoofsWhen returning from the trip, there's a scene with Lou and Will at a check-in counter at the airport. When flying with a private carrier, you don't go to a check-in counter, just pass through a separate security and ID control, and a private handler takes you to your jet at the apron.Quotes[Last lines] Will Traynor: [Voice over, narrating the letter Louisa is reading] Clark. A few weeks should have passed by the time you read this. If you follow the instructions, you'll be in Paris on one of those chairs that never sit quite level on a pavement. I hope it's still sunny. Across the bridge to your right, you'll see L'artisan Parfumeur. You should try the scent called Papiomextrem. I always did think it would smell great on you. There are few things I wanted to say and couldn't because you would've gotten emotional and you wouldn't have let me finish. So, here it is. When you get back home, Michael Lawler will give you access to a bank account that contains enough to give you a new beginning. Don't start panicking. It's not enough for you to sit around for the rest of your life but it should buy you your freedom, at least from that little town we both call home. Live boldly, Clark. Push yourself. Don't settle. Wear those stripy legs with pride. Knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury, knowing I might have given them to you. This eased something for me. So, this is it. You are scored on my heart, Clark. You have been the first day you walked in with your sweet smile and your ridiculous clothes and your bad jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt. Don't think of me too often. I don't want you getting sad. Just live well. Just live. I'll be walking beside you every step of the way.

The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia Clarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and wonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to none.Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who is paralyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romance develops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound disability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The movie depicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's own judgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would prefer to die.With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain and suffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the good times and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated, the character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love.helpful•44987whitbyscallyredJun 3, 2016Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateJune 16, 2016 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited KingdomUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial siteLanguagesEnglishFrenchAlso known asTruoc Ngay Em DenFilming locationsPembroke Castle, Pembrokeshire, Wales, UKProduction companiesMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)New Line CinemaOne Film at a TimeSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$20,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$56,245,075Opening weekend US & Canada$18,723,269Jun 5, 2016Gross worldwide$208,445,075See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 50 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Boys will be boys.Crazy creditsThe ""A"" and ""V"" in the film title are replaced with the ""Blade"" and the ""Chalice"" symbols described by Langdon in the movie.Alternate versionsThe film was originally shown to the UK censors in an unfinished form, with a temp score and sound mix. The BBFC advised Sony Pictures that sound levels during some acts of violence may be too impactful for the requested ""12A"" rating, so the film was likely to receive a 15 classification. When formally submitted, the final levels of sound effects on the completed soundtrack had reduced the strength of some acts of violence to an extent which made the film able to get a ""12A"" rating.ConnectionsFeatured in The Amazing Race: Herculean Effort for Some Herculean Dudes (2006)SoundtracksPhianoWritten and Performed by Dan BrownCourtesy of DGB RecordsUser reviews2.1KReviewReviewFeatured review7/10 better than many critics have given it credit forFrom the way the critics have gone after ""The Da Vinci Code,"" you'd think that Ron Howard himself had been jealously guarding the location of the Holy Grail all these years and was just now revealing it to all the world for his own nefarious (i.e. commercial) purposes. Actually, despite all the critical hostility and rancor, this turns out to be a reasonably entertaining adaptation of a reasonably entertaining novel, far from a classic or a work of art, but hardly the pile of cinematic refuse so many of the reviewers have led us to believe it is.As a work of history, the novel is a passel of nonsense, and only those with a bent towards conspiracy theory overload would be foolish enough to believe a minute of it. But as a work of imaginative fiction, ""The Da Vinci Code"" certainly gives its audience the neck-twisting workout they've paid good money to receive.It would be pointless to reiterate the plot of a novel that has probably had the biggest readership of any literary work since ""Gone With the Wind."" Suffice it to say that a mysterious murder in the Louvre sends a Harvard symbologist and the dead man's granddaughter on a clue-driven search for the famed Holy Grail. Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations.Despite the phenomenal - one is tempted to say ""unprecedented"" - commercial success of his work, Dan Brown is no great shakes as a writer; his characters are, almost without exception, drab and two-dimensional, and his dialogue, when it isn't being overly explicit in pouring out explanations, sounds like it was written by a first-year student in a Writer's 101 workshop. But the one undeniable talent Brown does have is his ability to knit together a preposterously complex web of codes and clues into an airtight tapestry, and to make it all convincing.The movie is very faithful to the novel in this respect. It moves quickly from location to location, never giving us too much time to question the logic (or illogic) of the narrative or to examine the many gaping plot holes in any great detail. Writer Akiva Goldsman has encountered his greatest trouble in the scenes in which the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters can lay out in laborious detail the elaborate story behind the clues. Yet, this is as much the fault of the nature and design of the novel as it is of the man given the unenviable task of bringing it to the screen. Moreover, perhaps in the interest of time and keeping the action flowing, Robert and Sophie come up with solutions to the myriad riddles much too quickly and accurately, with a ""Golly, gee, could it mean_______?"" attitude that borders on the ludicrous. But, somehow, Howard makes most of it work. Perhaps, it's the clunky literal-minded earnestness with which he approaches the subject that ultimately allows us to buy into it against our better judgment.Tom Hanks is stolid and passive as Dr. Robert Langdon, the college professor involuntarily driven into all this cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but Audrey Tautou has a certain subtle charm as Sophie, the woman who may play more of a part in the unraveling of the mystery than even she herself can imagine. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany have their moments as two of the less savory players in the story, but it is Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on all things related to the Holy Grail, who walks off with the film. His scenery-chewing shtick pumps some much needed life into a tale essentially populated by underdeveloped stick figures.The religious controversy surrounding both the novel and the film is as ludicrous as it is unjustified. Anyone whose belief system could be seriously shaken by this absurd mixture of unsubstantiated myth-making and plain old-fashioned wild speculation couldn't have had a very solid foundation of faith to begin with.The rest of us can appreciate ""The Da Vinci Code"" for what it is, an overblown but epic exercise in code-busting and clue-decoding - in short, the ""Gone With the Wind"" of whodunits.helpful•11943Buddy-51Jul 5, 2006Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ37How long is The Da Vinci Code?Powered by AlexaWhat is 'The Da Vinci Code' about?Is ""The Da Vinci Code"" based on a book?Is ""The Da Vinci Code"" based on a true story?DetailsEditRelease dateMay 18, 2006 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesMaltaFranceUnited KingdomLanguagesEnglishFrenchLatinSpanishAlso known asEl código Da VinciFilming locationsRosslyn Chapel, Midlothian, Scotland, UKProduction companiesColumbia PicturesImagine EntertainmentSkylark ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$125,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$217,536,138Opening weekend US & Canada$77,073,388May 21, 2006Gross worldwide$760,006,945See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 29 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDTSDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Fans have given him the unofficial Stormtrooper number JB-007. The Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2016) game finally revealed the Stormtrooper's actual designation: FN-1824.GoofsWhen Finn looks up at the sky while on Takodana, he observes the real time use of the First Order's Starkiller weapon, which is being used against a number of Republic Planets. Han also looks up and sees the planets' outlines in the sky. Given that this weapon was being fired from a different star system (with the star of that system providing the power), there is no way for Finn or Han to be able to observe light from the weapon in real time, as the light source would be many light years away. Also, they are supposedly in a different star system to that of the republic planets that were the target of the weapon, therefore there should have been nothing for our protagonists to see at all.QuotesHan Solo: What was your job when you were based here?Finn: Sanitation.Han Solo: Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?Finn: I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.Han Solo: People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.Finn: Solo, we'll figure it out. We'll use the Force.Han Solo: That's not how the Force works!Crazy creditsThe first ""Thank You"" credit (usually dedicated to benefactors of the film or to organizations or locations that gave permission for filming/technical advice/support) is dedicated to ""The patient family and friends of the cast and crew.""Alternate versionsThe end credits music is slightly different on the Blu-Ray version of the film - we get to hear a bit more of Rey's theme than what we heard in the theatrical version.ConnectionsEdited into If Star Wars Wasn't Serious (2014)SoundtracksJabba FlowWritten by Lin-Manuel Miranda and J.J. AbramsProduced and Performed by Shag KavaUser reviews4.8KReviewReviewFeatured review5/10 More of a remake than a sequel, it relies on nostalgia and spectacle over actual characters and story.In essence a remake of 'A New Hope' as opposed to a proper sequel, the check-box resemblance this long-awaited revival shares to its franchise's debut is genuinely uncanny and sadly staggering since this was the perfect opportunity to try something new considering that the 'Star Wars' moniker is a powerful enough box-office draw to recoup any budget, apparently no matter how exorbitant, and withstand more than a few bad apples (*cough* the prequels *cough*). What's here in 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)' is based on nothing more than nostalgia, a series of slightly sickening ""remember this thing""'s and ""this guy still looks the same but he's grey now""'s that become incredibly tiresome increasingly quickly. If you take away the franchise underlayer you're just left with a hollow, characterless piece that gives you no reason to care and very little actual information despite all its endless exposition. In the end, I was honestly bored even during all of its high-flying fanfare. 5/10helpful•415Pjtaylor-96-138044Apr 10, 2018Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign in'Star Wars' Stars In and Out of Costume'Star Wars' Stars In and Out of CostumeMary Elizabeth Winstead as Hera in ""Ahsoka"" plus more stars from a galaxy far, far away.See the galleryPhotosFAQ46How long is Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens?Powered by AlexaWhen does this take place in the Star Wars timeline?Why is Vader's mask melted?Why does C-3PO have a red arm?DetailsEditRelease dateDecember 16, 2015 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial HotstarLanguageEnglishAlso known asStar Wars: The Force AwakensFilming locationsSkellig Michael, County Kerry, Ireland(final scene)Production companiesLucasfilmBad RobotWalt Disney PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$245,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$936,662,225Opening weekend US & Canada$247,966,675Dec 20, 2015Gross worldwide$2,071,310,218See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 18 minutesColorColorSound mix12-Track Digital SoundDolby AtmosDolby Surround 7.1DatasatDolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackSonics-DDPAuro 11.1Aspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Yet realism, emotional or otherwise, is beside the point: this is a film that prints the legend, perhaps on the assumption that nothing is too cornball for true wrestling fans.

AUDIENCE REVIEWS FOR FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILY
Jun 27, 2019
Exceptional performances from Pugh and cast as well more laughs and charm than you'd expect make Fighting With My Family an ""internet darling"" of a film. The typical cliches and niches are there but the film gets a boost from its charismatic-electrifying producer to endure and entertain. 4.05/5


SUPER REVIEWER
Jun 10, 2019
Not really a Wrestling movie so much as it is a character study that may or may not be remotely accurate. I don't feel like I walked away from Fighting with My Family with a greater appreciation for the sport, but I did feel like I understood how the core cast felt about it.

But I found the plot, the motives, the backstory all much more interesting in this movie than the first one. Also liked Idris Elba's appearance. As seems to be the norm for this sort of movie, we got to see a variety of exotic firearms, from AKs with no stock to M240s and M249s to RPGs, PDWs, mini-guns, sniper weapons, etc. Also as usual, the weapons have extraordinary effect (not sure how you could get 40mm grenades to explode that close to the weapon that fired them) although hand-grenade explosions do seem to be close to accurate (the RPGs fly more like AT-4s though - RPGs don't really fire that accurately). Lots of bangs, lots of bashing, lots of knives (and axes and shovels and pitchforks), lots of shooting... but the plot actually has a start and a finish (and an opportunity for another one).helpful•15792ghatbkkJun 16, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ15How long is Extraction II?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJune 16, 2023 (Netherlands)Countries of originCzech RepublicAustriaAustraliaUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial NetflixLanguagesEnglishGeorgianFrenchGermanAlso known asExtraction IIFilming locationsVienna, Austria(DC Tower & surrounding area)Production companiesAGBOFilmhaus FilmsNetflixSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 2 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Extraction 2 (2023) officially released in the United Kingdom?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

     This article is a highly detailed plot summary of Gravity. 
Plot Summary[]
At 600 km above planet Earth, the temperature fluctuated between +258 and -148 degrees Fahrenheit. 


There was hing to carry sound.


No oxygen.


No air pressure.


Life in space was impossible.

The silence built to loud noise and the title was displayed before sudden silence and a shot of Earth from space. The Explorer Space Shuttle floated lazily 370 miles above the Earth’s surface. Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski propelled above it, strapped into an experimental propulsion pack. He radioed his compliments down to Houston before regaling the control room with the story of his trip to Tijuana from when his wife left him while he was on his first spacewalk. Houston reminded him that most of the workers down on Earth heard about the story before congratulating Matt on his upcoming retirement: This would be his last spacewalk. As he zipped around in the propulsion pack, Matt took it all in.
Below him, two other astronauts worked on the shuttle. Shariff Dasari, a flight engineer, gleefully jumped around on his tether – thoroughly enjoying the weightlessness. Nearby, on the docked Hubble Space Telescope, medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone diligently worked on repairing a faulty transmission card. Houston informed her that they are not receiving a signal before asking her to provide a new estimate on how long that the repairs should take: She needed sixty more minutes. 
Matt zipped over to Ryan and asked her if he could be of some assistance. He playfully flirted with her, asking about her training and complimenting her blue eyes. Stone laughed and claimed that her eyes are brown. Kowalski lamented that he would not be breaking the record for the longest spacewalk before he retired which was a personal career ambition. Houston confirmed that Matt would fall shy of the current record, but Matt decided to take his mind off it by telling a story about his time in New Orleans while he assisted Ryan with unscrewing the panel. A bolt floated away from the structure and Matt hopped out after it with a safety tether catching him as the line went taut closing his hand around the floating bolt. Ryan apologized, claiming that she was used to a basement lab where things fell to the floor. Before Matt could complete his story, Houston sent an urgent message: The astronauts need to return to the shuttle immediately because a cloud of satellite debris was hurling right for them at over 50,000 miles per hour.
Matt fired his way back toward Shariff and the Explorer while Houston explained: A Russian satellite self-destructed and the resulting cloud of debris was hurling toward the shuttle which lied directly in it’s orbit. The debris hurled forward through space toward the shuttle as Matt turned around to recover Ryan. Just as he reached her, the first bits of the debris began to pepper the Explorer striking Shariff and sending him off into space and the only thing catching him was the tether. The storm of the debris ripped through the shuttle and destroyed the structure, sending Ryan off into the void. Matt, shielded by a large chunk of the structure continued issuing commands to Ryan insisting that she should detach herself from the structure or else be carried too far from the shuttle. Already, he could not see her anymore. Stone complied and released the strap only to be flung even further out into space.

    Stone drifting into space.  Ryan quickly tumbled away through the vast expanse of space with no control over her movements which was the slightest one with the potential to leave her spinning out in space forever. Matt continued to radio instructions while she begged for assistance ordering her to give him any information that she could that could help him locate her position, but she was spinning too fast to observe her environment. As she started to slow down, Matt’s voice cut out and she was left floating forward, although she managed to see the International Space Station in the distance. Her oxygen was dropping dangerously low. Ryan panicked, breathing heavily and calling out despite not receiving a transmission. After a few tense moments of Stone desperately trying to signal with her light, her radio crackled to life. Matt, using his propulsion pack found her. He blasted forward, colliding with her and tethering her to him so he could tow her back to the shuttle. After recovering Ryan, he transmitted his radio message to Houston, but received no response. Ryan asked him what the point of radioing into the dark was and Matt simply said that just because they could not hear Control did not mean that Control could not hear them. It could just save their lives.
The duo began their return toward the shuttle when Matt saw a space suit floating below them – Shariff, removed from his shuttle tether as well. Matt guided the propulsion pack toward Shariff and ordered Ryan to grab him. Looking at Shariff, she saw that a chunk of debris ripped through his helmet – leaving a hole through his face through which she could see clean through. She looked away, noticing for the first time a laminated photo tethered to Shariff’s suit of his family down below.
Arriving at the wreckage of the shuttle, they saw that the hull was breached and the rest of the crew died from being exposed to the freezing vacuum of space. With life support running dry, Matt made their next move clear: They need to get to the International Space Station nearby. Doing some quick calculations, the pair determined that they had 90 minutes to get there before the debris cloud completed it's orbit around the planet and caught up to them again – bigger than before as it added more satellite debris as it destroyed the other satellites in it's path.

    Stone and Kowalski drift to the ISS amidst the sunrise.  As Ryan continued to note her dwindling oxygen supply, Matt tried to calm her down by asking her about her normal life on Earth and if there was anyone thinking about her. Ryan proved evasive before Matt’s prodding resulted in a quieting confession: Years prior, her four year old daughter, Sarah had an accident on the school playground and died when she hit her head too hard. Stone revealed that every day after work at the hospital, she drove and listened to the radio to avoid thinking about it. Matt was startled, but did not respond and Ryan looked out at the Earth, lost in her own head. 
The ISS pulled into view, but there are clear signs of structural damage from the debris strike. The pair noticed that one of the Soyuz re-entry modules of the ISS was gone. The crew abandoned the station. The other Soyuz was damaged in the debris strike, resulting in a parachute that was deployed and currently entangled around the station. Matt told her that while it could not bring them back to Earth, they could use it to get to a nearby Chinese space station, the Tiangong-1. Kowalski checked his propulsion pack: There are only two bursts left if they are lucky. At this time, Ryan's tank ran out of oxygen, but she had a small amount in her suit.
As their oxygen supplies began to bottom out, Matt fired the remaining bursts toward the ISS. As the two blasted forward, they struck the ISS and rolled forward tumbling away from one another. Ryan successfully caught on to the part of the ISS’s paneling, but Matt was not so lucky, bouncing off the paneling and out to space. Their connection tether snapped tight, ripping Ryan free of the ISS and dragging her out into space. As they are pulled out into space, Ryan’s leg caught on the parachute cords of the Soyuz module – keeping her attached to the ISS. But, Matt saw that the connection was tenuous at best. His momentum from continuous deceleration was going to pull her free and they would both die. Ryan realized that Matt was going to detach his suit from the connection tether and begged him not to, but Matt told her that she had to get back to the planet. He disconnected the tether and floated off.
As Ryan was propelled back toward the ISS by the disconnect, Matt continued to tell her what to do. Her space suit began blaring alarms. She had no oxygen remaining, only carbon dioxide. Kowalski instructed Ryan to climb up the side of the ISS to the airlock roughly 40 feet away and made her promise that she was going to make it. Instead, Stone claimed that she intended to take the Soyuz and retrieve him first. He told her that the ship sailed because he had too much of a head start on her and joked that he would hold the record for the longest spacewalk for a long time. Stone said that she would make it for him. Kowalski asked her if she was attracted to him, claiming that many women said that he had beautiful blue eyes. Stone said that he had beautiful blue eyes and Kowalski claimed that his eyes are brown. Kowalski told Stone that the Sun on the Ganges was beautiful. Ryan was now only breathing the carbon dioxide in her suit, causing her to lose consciousness. In her oxygen-deprived state, she reached out to Kowalski in an attempt to grab him with her vision distorted and her mental state slowing as she lost consciousness from hypercapnia. Ryan eventually was forced to jump into space toward the airlock and she barely reached it. She opened the airlock just in time and activated the decompression unit flooding the chamber with oxygen. She stripped her suit and breathed large gulps of air as she floated. She slowly curled into the fetal position and fell asleep, relieved to be alive.

     Stone attempts to repair the Zvezda Module by detaching the parachute.  
After taking a few minutes to recover, Ryan started to make her way through the ISS. Despite the damage, the oxygen atmosphere was still intact. She passed by the sparking wires which ignited the balls of fire that floated through the pure oxygen environment. Ryan failed to notice this because she was too preoccupied to contact Kowalski. She quickly put on a headset and contacted Kowalski who was not responding. At first, she chastised him, claiming that now was the only time during the whole mission where he stopped talking, but she asked him to continue his Mardi-Gras Story, begging him to tell her what happened with the hairy guy. Kowalski still did not reply and she was forced to transmit to Houston that she was the sole survivor of the mission with Kowalski having apparently succumbed to carbon dioxide poisoning in his spacesuit. She looked somberly out the window at Earth so close yet so far away. However, it would seem that the ISS, her sanctuary may be her tomb. The sparks from the exposed wiring started a massive fire inside the ISS which was quickly engulfing the entire station, making her sanctuary a tomb. Ryan grabbed a fire extinguisher and tried to fight the inferno, but the lack of gravity caused the extinguisher's recoil to push her into a wall, bruising and cutting her face. She lost consciousness for a moment as her blood dripped into space, but luckily was able to wake up and race past the fire, making it into the second Soyuz Capsule just in time as the inferno engulfed the node that she was in. Stone also took the fire extinguisher with her in case a blaze should erupt inside the Soyuz.
Ryan glanced at her watch and realized that she had seven minutes to escape the ISS before the debris completed another orbit and wiped the remainder of the station out. She fired the thrusters and the capsule lurched free away from the ISS before jerking to a stop suddenly. The parachute cables kept the Soyuz anchored to the ISS. She quickly dressed into a spare spacesuit and went outside the Zvezda Module and began releasing the parachute cables from the capsule as the debris strike arrived, blasting the ISS that deflected narrowly away from Ryan’s Soyuz. As the ISS was destroyed, Ryan scrambled back into the Soyuz and fired it away from the debris, remarking: ""I hate space"".
Ryan reset her watch to 90 minutes and began setting the Soyuz’s flight path up to line it up with the Chinese space station. When she pressed the fire button, she realized that she was out of fuel. Stone nearly had a breakdown after smacking the equipment, but eventually just stopped doing anything and wondered what to do. Having stayed in the capsule for some time and already suffering from hypercapnia, Stone began feeling dizzy from carbon dioxide poisoning, realizing that she would die unless she got help fast. Desperate for some sort of assistance, Stone tried to use the radio as a last resort, but only managed to stumble upon the frequency of a ham radio belonging to a Greenlandic fisherman who did not speak English. Stone at first believed it to be a person from the Chinese space station, but realized that he was calling from Earth after hearing his dogs barking. Stone gave up hope after she realized that the man could not understand her pleas. Wanting some sort of accompaniment, she asked him to make the dogs bark and after barking along with them, she broke down crying, claiming that she was going to die and knowing this terrified her. Ryan asked him to say a prayer for her as she was stuck in space and would be torn apart by the debris field with no one to know that she survived. However, when Stone heard the man cooing his baby with a lullaby, she remembered how she used to sing to her baby and realized that she wanted to die so there was no more pain over the loss of her child. Accepting that she would die, she turned the oxygen flow off to the cabin and turned the lights off for a painless suicide. Stone was slowly drifting to a deep sleep to succumb to oxygen deprivation when there was a knock on the door from an astronaut gesturing outside! 

     ""How did you get here?""  As she started to resist, he turned the handle and opened the hatch. Quickly swinging in, the astronaut plopped down beside her and removed his helmet. It was Matt! He grinned broadly, reactivating the oxygen flow to the cabin and told her that he beat the spacewalk record. Ryan asked him how he managed to get back to her and Matt explained: Having tinkered around with the propulsion pack, he managed to get a few more bursts out of it to guide him back her way. She told him that the fuel was all gone, but he pointed out that the capsule had re-entry rockets for landing. He told her that she could pilot her way to the station that way. Matt looked over everything and realized that she was trying to kill herself, telling her that losing a daughter made everything harder, but that was not a reason to want to die. He conceded that if she really wanted to give up, all of what she had to do was stay there shutting the air flow down once more. Delirious from hypoxia and barely able to speak, Stone asked him how he got there and he told her that it was ""a hell of a story"" before telling Ryan that ""it was time to go home"". She turned around to look at Kowalski only to see that he was gone, revealing that he was a hallucination resulting from severe oxygen deprivation. Ryan gasped back to consciousness, realizing that she was still alone. She reactivated the air flow to the cabin and as the oxygen levels rose, she began to recover remembering what her subconscious was trying to tell her by manifesting Kowalski: That the re-entry rockets ran on a separate fuel tank and she could still make it to Tiangong. With renewed determination, she fired the thrusters and shot off toward the Chinese station on momentum.
As the Soyuz capsule flew forward, Ryan saw that the station was greatly damaged by the debris and was sinking into the atmosphere. Stone also noticed that she would miss the station by several meters. Retrieving the fire extinguisher that she used to fight the fire on the ISS, she blasted the airlock open with pyrotechnics via explosive decompression and was thrown out into space. Using the fire extinguisher to propel herself toward the Chinese space station, she slammed into it and managed to hang on as Tiangong dropped faster through the Earth's atmosphere and began a rapid descent. The debris field reappeared in the distance, racing toward her as she began her climb to the airlock while the station began to break apart. 
The debris strike slammed into the Chinese space station, shredding it and rapidly forcing the station out of it's orbit toward a re-entry. Ryan climbed into the airlock, determined to reach the Shenzou. She reached the capsule in time just as the station started to plummet through the upper atmosphere, 150 kilometers above planet Earth. Stone struggled to make sense of the symbols pressing random buttons to see if she could initialize the re-entry protocol. Luckily, because the Shenzou was pretty much like the Soyuz, she was able to piece together what she needed to allow the Shenzou to disengage it's locks and undock from the surrounding Tiangong as what was left of it hurled through the Earth's upper atmosphere 120 kilometers above planet Earth at over 25,000 feet per second. Ryan said a prayer to Matt and asked him to tell her daughter that she loved her and she was proud of her. She also told Houston over the radio that she had a newfound will to live and whether she lived or died, she was ready for whatever came her way. 

     What's left of the Tiangong enters Earth's atmosphere.  The capsule exploded forward, taking the lead of the debris field as the station fell apart with each passing second erupting into lines of fire across the sky. Ryan closed her eyes and put the helmet to her spacesuit on. Tiangong continued breaking apart when the gravity took hold and dragged it down to the Earth's lower atmosphere, 70 kilometers above the surface. Luckily, the parachute was activated 10 kilometers above the surface, slowing the capsule and allowing it to land gently in a lake of water somewhere in the American Southwest.
The capsule hit the water and floated for a moment with the radio cracking to life as Houston was finally able to make contact, promising a rescue. However, an electrical fire broke out, forcing Stone to escape the Shenzou immediately. She ejected the hatch and the Shenzou rapidly filled with water and struggled to breathe. For a moment, it seemed like she would drown and the weight of the capsule and parachute quickly dragged it to the bottom. Stone tried to swim to the surface, but the eighty pound spacesuit pinned her to the bottom of the lake. Stone was forced to frantically strip the heavy suit away to allow her to make a desperate flight to the surface.  
Ryan bursted out of the water and floated on the surface, taking a moment to catch her breath where she saw the remaining debris of Tiangong completing it's own re-entry and burning up across the sky. Stone was able to swim to shore where she collapsed momentarily on the beach, laughing and gripping the sand in her hands, happy to be on land again. Forcing herself to stand and walk to await rescue, she took her first shaky steps on dry land, acclimating herself to existing in the Earth's gravity.

BackCast & crewUser reviewsTriviaFAQIMDbProAll topicsPlotGood Night, and Good Luck.Jump toSummaries (2)Synopsis (1)EditSummariesBroadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow looks to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy.In the early 1950's, the threat of Communism created an air of paranoia in the United States and exploiting those fears was Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. However, CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow and his producer Fred W. Friendly decided to take a stand and challenge McCarthy and expose him for the fear monger he was. However, their actions took a great personal toll on both men, but they stood by their convictions and helped to bring down one of the most controversial senators in American history.—Brian Washington <Sargebri@att.net>SynopsisThe movie begins on Oct. 25, 1958, at a fancy dinner tribute to Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn). It's the usual gala affair, everyone is dressed up and looking expensive. Ed Murrow is introduced as a hero who fought against McCarthyism. Ed comes out and proceeds to make a speech about how journalism has become occupied with presenting only good news and how journalists have succumbed to escapism, losing touch with the real world. This attack makes the audience uncomfortable and Fred Friendly (George Clooney) looks like he's having a good time.Flashback to 1953. Joe Wershba (Robert Downey Jr.) and Shirley Wershba (Patricia Clarkson) are alone in the copy room; someone walks in and jokingly asks what people might think. Joe takes Shirley aside and tells her about a loyalty (to McCarthy or the government) oath she must sign, or he may get fired. After some thought, she agrees, and they kiss.The newsmen are in a conference room, trying to decide news pieces for the next show. People mention some McCarthy related topics but are immediately shot down given the controversy involved. Someone brings up the topic of an air force officer in Chicago, who was dismissed from the air force because his father was deemed to be a communist or have communist ties. At his trial, all charges and evidence were in a sealed envelope, which no one saw. The Air Force Officers rights to a fair trial were clearly violated, as he didn't even know the charges against him and was found guilty anyway. The newsmen are reluctant to pursue this, afraid of a backlash from McCarthy.They agree to send two people to Chicago to get some footage and decide from there. Later, the crew is watching footage of the Air Force Officer saying that he would not want his kids to be persecuted for the affiliations of their parents and have to denounce their own father. Ed, Fred, and a third man, are in a room, trying to decide whether to run the piece. Ed is completely for it, while the third man is opposed, mentioning their sponsorship from Alcoa, who is dependent on government contracts. Fred seems to be ambivalent, but trusting Ed. They decide to run it as a piece against the infringement of civil liberties and not mention McCarthy.Fred is met in his office by two Colonels, who proceed to berate him about jeopardizing national security, interfering with government business, etc. Fred asks the Colonels if they know the contents of the sealed envelope and they clearly don't. The story runs; Ed comments on the sealed envelope and closes with his signature ""Good Night and Good Luck"". We see a bit of the show that runs after Ed's, its Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) praising Eds courage and reporting. There is a tense moment as everyone waits for the phones to ring and none do. Someone in the back asks if he should turn the phones back on and the tension is eased. The phones start ringing off the hook.Later, the crew, along with Don, is having drinks at a bar and decides to get the early edition newspaper reviews of the show. The first one comes out very good, the second one not. Some people look relaxed, some angry, but Don looks very uneasy.
William (Bill) Paley (Frank Langella), boss at CBS, summons Fred to his office and chews him out for the piece, mentioning their sponsorship from Alcoa. However, Bill doesn't actually ask Fred to stop reporting on McCarty issues; he seems to both enjoy yelling at Fred and also trust Fred's judgment. Joe and Shirley are getting ready for work, before Joe leaves, Shirley reminds him to take off his wedding ring. It turns out that they are secretly married, which is against company policy. Later, Joe is approached by someone from the government, who warns Joe about running future McCarthy pieces, saying, ""What if I told you that Ed Murrow was on the Soviet payroll in 1932?""The crew decides to run a direct attack on McCarthy. McCarthy is holding a senate hearing on a woman who supposedly works in the Pentagon Code Room and is a Communist spy. Although the hearing isn't a real trial, they get the woman fired from her job. The woman in the hearing doesn't actually work in the Code Room and denies any Communist ties. Apparently, an FBI agent saw her name on a Communist mailing list and that is all the evidence they are going on. The news crew point out several things wrong with the hearing: the woman has the same name as three others in the phone book and McCarthy himself leaves the hearing after a few questions. All of these facts are brought to light in Eds show, and Ed volunteers to give McCarthy a chance to defend himself on the show.McCarthy takes up the offer and basically uses the show to make a series of accusations about Eds ties to Communism: a writer with communist ties had dedicated a book to Ed, Ed was on the Soviet payroll in 1932 for some foreign exchange program, and Ed is a card-carrying member of the International Industrial Workers association, which is known to be communist. Ed uses the next show to rebut: he was a friend of the author despite their different beliefs, he doesn't deny the second charge, and the third charge is untrue. Ed also says that since McCarthy didn't refute any facts Ed reported about him, the world can assume they are true.The newsmen are sitting around and find out that the Air Force Officer from the first story was reinstated back to the army. At the same time, they also learn that Don Hollenbeck has committed suicide, apparently the pressure was too much for him. In other news, the Senate declares an investigation on McCarthy.Joe and Shirley are called into the editor's office and are told about an upcoming layoff. The editor mentions that it is against company policy for two employees to be married and everyone knows they are married. In a happy moment, the two put their rings back on and Joe decides to quit. Bill Paley calls Fred and Ed into his office tells them that CBS lost the Alcoa sponsorship and will have to lay a lot of people off. Ed yells at Bill for his trying to censor them, but Bill responses that he showed his reservations, but had never stopped them from running a piece. Bill tells Ed that his show will be cut from 1 hour to 30 minutes, moved to Sunday afternoon, and Ed will only do five more shows. Ed and Fred walk to the elevator and say that they might as well go out with a bang in their last five shows. Fred mentions that Joe and Shirley were married, and Ed seems to be the only one who didn't know.Cut back to Oct. 25, 1958. Ed finishes his speech saying that journalists are the ones with the responsibility to keep the public informed of the real world, regardless of its unpleasantness. Good night and good luck.

Patriot Games is a 1992 American action thriller film directed by Phillip Noyce and based on Tom Clancy's 1987 novel of the same name. It is a sequel to the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October, part of a series of films featuring Clancy's character Jack Ryan, but with different actors in the leading roles. Harrison Ford stars as Jack Ryan and Anne Archer as his wife, and James Earl Jones reprises his role as Admiral James Greer. The cast also includes Sean Bean, Patrick Bergin, Thora Birch, Samuel L. Jackson, James Fox, and Richard Harris.
During production, Clancy repeatedly voiced his displeasure with his understanding of the script, in particular details of technical items to be shown onscreen and the 49-year-old Ford conflicting with his vision of Jack Ryan's age, but publicly stated his satisfaction once he actually saw a cut of the film a few weeks before it was released.
The film premiered in theaters in the United States on June 5, 1992, and spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, grossing $178.1 million worldwide at the box office. It received a generally positive reception from critics. It was followed by Clear and Present Danger (1994), with Ford, Archer, Jones and Birch reprising their roles.


Plot[edit]
Former CIA analyst Jack Ryan now teaches history at the United States Naval Academy. In London with his physician wife, Cathy, and their young daughter Sally, Ryan witnesses and intervenes in a terrorist kidnapping attempt on Lord William Holmes, the British Minister of State for Northern Ireland and a cousin to the Queen. Ryan is wounded but disarms one terrorist and fatally shoots two others, then subdues Sean Miller. Among those killed is Miller's younger brother. All belong to a radical IRA splinter cell led by Kevin O'Donnell. Shortly after the incident, IRA operatives attempt and fail to assassinate O'Donnell, considering him and his followers too radical.
Miller is tried and convicted. As he is being transported to prison, O'Donnell and his comrades ambush the police convoy, killing the guards and freeing Miller. Fleeing to North Africa, O'Donnell plans the next attempt on Lord Holmes. Miller vows to avenge his brother's death, and O'Donnell allows him, O'Donnell's lover, Annette, and several others to travel to the US to assassinate Ryan. Meanwhile, British police have determined that an informant has been tipping off the terrorists and are surveilling a book shop owner who is an IRA operative.
Back in the United States, Ryan is informed about Miller's escape. Soon after, he narrowly survives an assassination attempt by Miller's accomplices, while Miller simultaneously targets Cathy while she drives home to Annapolis on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, causing her car to crash into a highway divider, seriously injuring Sally, who has to have a splenectomy. Ryan's former CIA superior, Vice Admiral James Greer, asks Ryan to rejoin the agency to help capture the terrorists. While investigating, Ryan recalls glimpsing a red-headed woman during the attacks on him and Lord Holmes. Ryan approaches Sinn Fein representative Paddy O'Neil for information. O'Neil denies IRA involvement and denounces the attacks, but refuses to betray any fellow Irishmen. Ryan threatens to sabotage O'Neil's American fundraising efforts by showing images of his hospitalized daughter to the media. O'Neil eventually relents and identifies the red-haired female accomplice as an Englishwoman (Annette). Finding her will lead to Miller. Satellite analysis indicates that Miller and O'Donnell are at a terrorist training camp in Libya. The Special Air Service raid the camp, killing everyone, though Miller, O'Donnell, and their cohorts have already fled to North America to coincide with Lord Holmes's visit there.
While Lord Holmes is at the Ryan residence to present Ryan's KCVO medal, a severe thunderstorm apparently knocks out the house's power. Ryan notices the boat-house lights are still on, and he is unable to radio any DSS agents or state troopers guarding the premises. He deduces the house's power was deliberately cut and fears an imminent attack. Ryan realizes that Holmes's assistant, Watkins, is the informant and forces him to reveal information. Outside, O'Donnell, Miller, and their team have killed all security personnel, then infiltrate the house. After Ryan and his Naval Academy associate, Lt. Commander Robby Jackson, eliminate several terrorists, Ryan lures O'Donnell, Miller, and Annette into pursuing him on open water in their waiting speed boats. Upon realizing it is a ruse, O'Donnell demands they return and complete their mission to abduct and ransom Holmes. Miller, crazed with revenge against Ryan, refuses, then fatally shoots O'Donnell and Annette. He leaps aboard Ryan's boat where a struggle ensues; Ryan kills Miller and jumps overboard just before the burning boat crashes into jutting rocks and explodes. An FBI Hostage Rescue Team arrives, rescuing Ryan.

Production[edit]
Development and casting[edit]
Viacom tried to option the rights for an ABC television adaptation of Patriot Games after the release of the novel in 1987. However, Tom Clancy got into a legal dispute over whether he had retained the character in his deal for the U.S. Naval Institute to publish the previous novel in the series The Hunt for Red October.[2] In 1988, during the pre-production of the film adaptation of The Hunt for Red October, Paramount Pictures issued another lawsuit claiming that it had purchased the rights to the character of Jack Ryan with its $455,000 contract to adapt The Hunt for Red October and that the ABC adaptation could not move forward. Although Tom Clancy's attorney Robert Yodelman disputed Paramount's claim to full character rights, the lawsuit led to the project's cancellation.[3] After the release of The Hunt for Red October, Paramount Pictures paid $2.5 million for the rights to Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger.[4]
The actors who played Jack and Caroline Ryan in The Hunt for Red October, Alec Baldwin and Gates McFadden, did not appear in the film. Baldwin was in negotiations to reprise his role, but committed to perform in A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway after filming on Patriot Games was delayed by two months.[5][6] In 2011, Baldwin claimed the role was recast due to David Kirkpatrick forcing him to choose between performing in A Streetcar Named Desire or agreeing to an open-ended clause relating to dates for the first sequel.[7] Baldwin further claimed this occurred after a famous actor, widely believed to be the film's eventual star Harrison Ford, offered to play Ryan. Ford was favored by both the studio and the director John McTiernan due to a large debt the studio owed to him from Harold Becker's unproduced historical film Night Ride Down, a film set around a labor union strike in the 1930s, which was cancelled due to the early 1990s recession, and script changes Ford disagreed with.[a] McTiernan had originally desired Ford in the role in the first film and confirmed that  ""there was a great deal of scheming that went on to push Alec out of that part.""[14] Kirkpatrick responded to Baldwin's claims by saying that negotiations with him to reprise the role had already broken due to his insistence on script approval.[10] Ford signed a $9 million three-picture contract to play Ryan after Baldwin's departure.[4][5][12]
McTiernan initially wanted to follow The Hunt for Red October by directing an adaptation of Clear and Present Danger using a script written by John Milius.[15][16] After the studio opted to adapt Patriot Games, he declined to direct because of his Irish-American background. Walter Hill, Kevin Reynolds, and John Badham were considered to replace McTiernan. Badham was almost hired but asked for too high a fee, and Phillip Noyce was chosen instead. Donald Stewart returned from the first film to co-write the script with W. Peter Iliff.[4]
In the original novel, the assassination attempt was made on the Prince of Wales and many members of the British royal family appeared as important characters. They were replaced with fictitious characters in the screenplay, with Prince Charles being replaced by Lord Holmes, a nonexistent cousin of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.[15][17]

Filming[edit]
Shooting began on November 2, 1991. The budget was initially $28 million, but was raised to $40 million by Brandon Tartikoff. The movie was filmed on location in areas around London, at Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and at Pinewood Studios.[6] Scenes were also filmed at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.[18] Jack Ryan's home was filmed on the California coast and made to look like it was in Maryland.[19]
The scenes set at a terrorist camp in Libya were filmed in the desert near Brawley, California. To make the attack on the camp appear as infrared footage, actors wearing black body suits were filmed from a helicopter and the resulting video images were reversed in post-production.[20]
Patriot Games was the first movie to be allowed to film at the George Bush Center for Intelligence, CIA Headquarters.[21]
Filming also took place at Aldwych tube station (closed 1994), which was then only being used for weekday peak hour service, for a sequence later in the film.[22]
Test audiences in April 1992 responded negatively to the original ending, which had Jack Ryan and Sean Miller fighting underwater. The ending was re-shot with a more explosive finale.[23][24] The reshoots increased the film's production budget to $45 million,[25] and with the marketing budget included, the cost to the studio was $65 million.[4] While reshooting the scene, Harrison Ford accidentally hit Sean Bean with a boat hook; Bean has a scar over his eye as a result.[26]
Before seeing the film, numerous differences between the script and the novel caused Clancy to distance himself from the film production.[24] Clancy was unhappy with details of technical items scripted to be shown onscreen, and complained about the age of then-49-year-old Ford, as compared to the 34-year-old Baldwin, to portray his vision of Ryan.[4][27] During production he asked for his name to be taken off the film. He complained that the final attack scene was ""unrealistic"" and that he had not been shown any rushes. He said he was not sure a film of Clear and Present Danger would be made, as the script for Patriot Games meant it ""will turn out so bad.""[28] However, after meeting with Tartikoff and actually seeing a cut of the film, which did not – in fact – contain the details that Clancy mistakenly thought were going to be in the film, Clancy was ""impressed with how the movie depicted the CIA’s intelligence-gathering process"", and stated that he looked forward to working with the studio on the adaptation of Clear and Present Danger.[27]

Patriot Games: Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack(1992)

Clear and Present Danger(1994)

On June 9, 1992, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the RCA Records music label. The film's musical score was composed by James Horner and contains musical references to works by Aram Khachaturian (Adagio from ""Gayane"" Suite) and Dmitri Shostakovich (Symphony No. 5, 3rd mvt.). A music video is shown in an early scene featuring Clannad's song ""Theme from Harry's Game"", originally made for an ITV drama about The Troubles in 1982.  All other vocal performances featured on the soundtrack were performed by Maggie Boyle.[29]
In 2013, a 2-disc expanded soundtrack album was released by La-La Land Records. Limited to 3000 copies, the album contains over 50 minutes of previously unreleased music (including cues by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and John Philip Sousa).[30]

Reception[edit]
Critical response[edit]
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 72% of 102 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: ""Patriot Games doesn't win many points for verisimilitude, but some entertaining set pieces -- and Harrison Ford in the central role -- more than compensate for its flaws.""[31] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating ""generally favorable"" reviews.[32] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average score of ""A-"" on an A+ to F scale.[33]
Roger Ebert called it ""absorbing"" while also commenting that Harrison Ford ""once again demonstrates what a solid, convincing actor he is"".[34] Chris Hicks of the Deseret News mentioned how director Noyce gave the film ""flourish and tension"" while star Harrison Ford injected ""a commanding sense of decency and humanity to the role of CIA analyst Jack Ryan, making it his own.""[35]
There was controversy associated with the specifics of a negative review by Joseph McBride, in Variety.[36] McBride, of Irish descent, wrote that it was ""fascistic, blatantly anti-Irish"", and that the likely opening weekend box office draw of Harrison Ford would quickly be eliminated when ""downbeat word-of-mouth spreads like wildfire.""[37] In response, the editor-in-chief of Variety, Peter Bart, sent a letter to Martin S. Davis, chairman of Paramount, which – while not apologizing for the review being negative – stated that it was unprofessional for McBride to impose his political opinions into the film review.[36] While some staff at Variety were disapproving of the letter, others confirmed that they were ""embarrassed"" by McBride including his political views.[36]

Box office[edit]
Patriot Games grossed $83.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $94.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $178.1 million, against a budget of $45 million.[25] It debuted at No. 1 for the weekend of June 5, 1992,[38] repeated in the top spot in its second weekend, and spent its first six weeks in the Top 10 at the box office.[39]

It's the typical oops we have switched bodies but something has to change in the family dynamics before we can be switched back scenario. I can't say that we need 'another' one of these films.

One day, Keanu Reeves noticed a sign on a lawn that read ""You're breathtaking"". He stopped, got out of the car, went to the sign and autographed it. After finding out who the sign belonged to, he went to the family and posed for a photo with them.GoofsThe Rufus hologram mentions first meeting Bill and Ted in 1989. Though Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure was released in '89, it was explicitly set in 1988.QuotesBill: Ted... We have a destiny to fulfill. Think about our fans, dude!Ted: Bob and Wendy will totally understand. Eileen, we haven't heard from for several years...Crazy creditsThere is a scene, after the credits, where old Bill and Ted have a final jam in the retirement home.ConnectionsFeatured in The Late Show with Stephen Colbert: Bland of Opportunity (2020)SoundtracksLost In TimeWritten by Jonathan BatesPerformed by Big Black DeltaCourtesy of Master of Bates / Nerve Artist ManagementUser reviews1KReviewReviewFeatured review6/10 A very good film...provided you are a fan already.If you've never seen the first two Bill & Ted movies, I suggest you pass on ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"". While this third film isn't bad, it certainly isn't as fun and original as the previous two...and it might also prove to be very confusing. But, if you are a fan already of the series, you'll enjoy this film provided you don't expect the impossible...for the film to recapture 100% of the charm and humor of the originals. Adjust your expectations and you will surely like the film.As far as the plot goes, it's pretty confusing. Suffice to say that after the second film, when it appeared that the whole world was saved by Bill & Ted, over time you come to see that it was a fluke and Bill & Ted of 2020 are losers. How do they over come this and why do they need to? See the film.To me, this film clearly was best released to video...which is what happened due to COVID. I would not have recommended you go to the theater to see it...but as a direct to DVD or film on a pay channel, it's well worth your time.helpful•5010planktonrulesDec 9, 2020Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ20How long is Bill & Ted Face the Music?Powered by AlexaAt the end of Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991), the characters had sons.

""In trying to write a team-based creative process, I wrote the one I know"", said Nolan.GoofsWhen Ariadne and Cobb are at the café, a man in a yellow jacket passes behind Cobb. The camera switches back and forth between Cobb and Ariadne several times. When it switches back to Cobb, the man in the yellow jacket passes once again. The person in the jacket is a projection and based on what the movie explains, projections behave a lot like extras. This means the same projection may reappear like that.QuotesCobb: What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient... highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.Crazy creditsAt the end of the credits Édith Piaf's ""Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien"" plays at normal speed, then slows down to the speed it was at the beginning of the film during Hans Zimmer's score and throughout the movie. Then we see the title stop in the center of the screen as the song ends.ConnectionsEdited into The Paul Behragam Talk Show: ""Balto"" R&T Part 5 (2015)SoundtracksNon, je ne Regrette rienMusic by Charles DumontLyrics by Michel VaucairePerformed by Édith PiafCourtesy of EMI Music FranceUnder license from EMI Film & Television MusicUser reviews4.7KReviewReviewFeatured review8/10 WaitWait, did i just watch this or is it just a dream?helpful•16948konradbuczakFeb 1, 2021Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ48Is the Michael Caine character Cobb or Mal's father?Why only Cobb brought his own projections (Mal, train, kids) in dreams?

1677145471827656,2,"I would highly recommend Frozen, it very much features two much loved sisters Elsa and Anna and a beloved prince, it's Christmas themed, also has a lot of singing and a adorable animated snowman

here is the summary

When the newly crowned Queen Elsa accidentally uses her power to turn things into ice to curse her home in infinite winter, her sister Anna teams up with a mountain man, his playful reindeer, and a snowman to change the weather condition.

Summary

                            In this dramatic courtroom thriller, Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), a Navy lawyer who has never seen the inside of the courtroom, defends two stubborn Marines (Wolfgang Bodison and James Marshall) who have been accused of murdering a colleague. He (Cruise) is known as being lazy and had arranged for a plea bargain. Downey's (Marshall) Aunt Ginny appoints Cmdr. Galloway (Demi Moore) to represent him. Also on the legal staff is Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak). The team rounds up many facts and Kaffee is discovering that he is really cut out for trial work. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago, the victim, was given a ""CODE RED"". Santiago was basically a screw-up. At Gitmo, screw-ups aren't tolerated. Especially by Col. Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson). In Cuba, Jessup and two senior officers (J.T. Walsh and Kiefer Sutherland) try to give all the help they can, but Kaffee knows something's fishy. In the conclusion of the film, the fireworks are set off by a confrontation between Jessup and Kaffee.

",
8063012020652887,2,"I would recommend the movie Major League 2.  It is a comedy about a hapless major league baseball team.  It is rated PG so it is suitable for the whole family.  The IMDB only ranks it as 5.6 out of 10 stars, but a lot of people find the movie hilarious.

Sasser was very successful at throwing out runners attempting to steal second, but had a mental block causing him to flinch several times when trying to throw the ball back to the pitcher. Many baserunners took advantage of this affliction and stole bases while he was triple pumping his throw, and/or lollipopping the throw back.GoofsWhen Willy Mays-Hayes yells to distract a player and cause him to drop a fly ball, the freeze-frame newspaper shot of that moment appears with the headline ""Tribe gives Jays the Willys."" However, the player who dropped the ball is clearly wearing a Baltimore Orioles uniform, not a Toronto Blue Jays one.QuotesHarry Doyle: So a tough loss for the Indians as Pedro Cerrano doubles off a pigeon and is tagged out while administering CPR before the tying run could score. Funny game ain't it Monty?Monte: Well at least the bird survived.Harry Doyle: Who cares?

At the time of their use, these were not ships known for their resistance to the elements. In fact, constant maintenance was required lest they literally deteriorate while in use. Such ships, after having been abandoned and partially submerged, while also in a tropical climate, would likely have rotted away to nothing after such a time.QuotesHotel Guest: [on seeing Nate and Chloe coming out of the ocean] Whoa!

That darn kid returns, only this time he's a man (sort of), and as what's supposed to be an added bonus: battle-ax Sunny--Willie's equally crass mother (Bates, though even she is helpless against this flimsy material). This unnecessary, uninspired, and untimely follow-up doesn't have much of a plot to keep it afloat, playing mostly as an exercise in unfunny jokes, profane dialogue, and bodily fluids.

Downey's Stark/Iron Man steals the show because the actor is capable of making the tritest dialogue sound wonderfully witty, but the CGI effects are amazing and, despite its length, the film is very enjoyable.

You wouldn’t accuse 'The Avengers' of being good drama, but the sprawling, splashy spectacle and its much-much-much-larger-than-life heroes makes for a genuine comic book epic for the big screen.

AUDIENCE REVIEWS FOR MARVEL'S THE AVENGERS
Apr 28, 2016
The Avengers was so much fun and Marvel absolutely nailed it! Let me explain what I loved! Positives: 1. The characters; this is a no brainer! Without these awesome characters this film would be nothing. They honestly shape this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome! There are a lot of humorous as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome film! 2. The villain; Loki in my opinion is the best villain of the MCU. He has motivation you understand and his rivalry with Thor is mesmerizing! Tom Hiddleston once again does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect villain for this movie. 3. The action; all of the action is done well! There is quite a lot of CGI, but it doesn't get in the way of the film, and because of these awesome characters all the action and explosions have weight to them. If these characters hadn't been characterized properly, and it didn't have a well made story then this film would've probably turned out like a Transformers movie. Thankfully that was not the case and all the action was awesome! Overall: I have no cons with this film that I can think of. The Avengers is one of the best comic book films I've ever seen! It is by far one of the best things Marvel has ever done and it was one of the most fun I've had watching a movie! Even if you aren't a comic book fan I guarantee you will enjoy this film! Don't go into this movie expecting a mindless action movie like Transformers, this film is a lot more deep than that.


SUPER REVIEWER
Mar 29, 2016
This is without a doubt the most well-made movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far. With the great visionary known as Joss Whedon at the helm and with a lot of rich characters already set up previously in their own solo films (with the exception of Black Widow and Hawkeye, who appeared as secondary characters or cameos in the previous films). It is one of those movies that is always worth watching again and it's definitely deserves the title of one of the highest-grossing films of all time.


SUPER REVIEWER
Mar 26, 2016
Thank's to Joss Whedon's brilliant scripting and directing, The Avengers succeeds as both a stand alone picture and a great ensemble crossover for the fans. The action is non-stop, yes, but after 5 movies of build up I think it's warranted and accepted.

By far the best MCU film and one of the best superhero films of all time. The Avengers is action packed, smart, funny and filled with delicious popcorn fun!

And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.****1/2 of ***** starshelpful•27450basruttenDec 24, 2004Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ4Is ""The Incredibles"" based on a book?Why does that scene with Frozone and the cup of water seem so familiar?Any recommendations for other movies by Pixar Animation Studios?DetailsEditRelease dateNovember 24, 2004 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesJapanOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookPixarLanguagesEnglishFrenchGermanItalianPortugueseRussianAlso known asThe FantasticsFilming locationsWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

9.46658E+15,1,"While Will Ferrell is more known for his comedic roles, he did take on a more action-oriented character in the film ""Land of the Lost"" (2009). It's a science fiction adventure-comedy where Ferrell's character, Dr. Rick Marshall, is transported to an alternate universe. Please note that this film is more of a comedic take on action-adventure rather than a traditional action movie.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457400/

If you're specifically looking for Will Ferrell in action-comedy roles, ""Land of the Lost"" might be an interesting choice. However, it's important to keep in mind that Ferrell's filmography is primarily centered around comedy rather than action genres.

The fact of the matter is that this film is fun and well made. To get some negatives out of the way first, its definitely got a few obnoxious crude jokes. It also could have been a bit funnier at times. But overall it definitely put me in a good mood, especially because I'm a huge Will Ferrell and Danny McBride fan. I love how Wll Ferrell can deliver such ridiculous lines of dialogue with a straight face. Despite being a major Hollywood film, I felt like this film had heart to it and didn't really feel hollow. I know I had already touched on this before but I just don't think all the hate on this movie is justified. It's coherent from beginning to end, all the lines are delivered well and it's very goofy. Not to mention the cgi isn't half bad as well.Overall it's definitely a fun movie with a few small flaws. Ignore all the hate and go into this with an open mind, not expecting it to be quite like the old TV show, and you'll probably enjoy yourself.helpful•9334kyleson_8Sep 21, 2012Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ20How long is Land of the Lost?Powered by AlexaIs ""Land of the Lost"" based on a book?Which characters from the TV series appear in the movie?DetailsEditRelease dateJune 5, 2009 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial site (France)Official site (Japan)LanguageEnglishAlso known asTrôi Về Thời Tiền SửFilming locationsDumont Dunes, California, USAProduction companiesUniversal PicturesRelativity MediaSid & Marty Krofft PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$100,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$49,438,370Opening weekend US & Canada$18,837,350Jun 7, 2009Gross worldwide$68,777,554See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 42 minutesColorColorSound mixSDDSDolby DigitalDTSAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Yes, it's all about a teen romance but it is also about a deep friendship, not only between the two girls but also between all of the main characters. It is a very entertaining film, full of comedic moments but also will invoke those strong pangs of a first love. It is well acted, particularly by the two main teens who fall in love. The subtitling will not distract you from the story nor will you lose the emotion of the movie. Make sure you watch it to the very end.

Part Deux (1993)SoundtracksAll Alone on ChristmasWritten and Produced by Steven Van Zandt (as Steven Van Zandt)Performed by Darlene LoveUser reviews360ReviewReviewFeatured review9/10 My personal favourite of the franchiseThe first Home Alone is very good indeed. The last two are just wannabes and feel like they don't belong. Home Alone 2 is my personal favourite, and I watch it about once a month. The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance. I absolutely adored the soundtrack too, New York looks splendid and the Plaza Hotel was incredible to look at. Brilliant movie! 9/10.

One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.So far this year we have been treated to an unusually high dosage of stoner comedies, with Pineapple Express being a late third behind the too-dumb-for-it's-own-good Strange Wilderness and the dumb-but-fun Harold & Kumar. However, despite coming in late to the game, the old expression of ""saving the best 'till last"" seems applicable here. Where previous instalments from this year combined the dumb with surreal through incoherent situations obviously dreamt up from people who were under the influence at the time, Pineapple Express feels silly, but not the extent where the entire feature boils down to caricature comedy. Here the writers take two characters, start them off one place and take them on an adventure not just through crime, car-chases, comical fight scenes and little personal squabbles, but through themselves. It's a combination which could have had a disastrously polarising effect, but the writers get it spot on here.Main characters Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) and Saul Silver (James Franco) may have alliterative names akin to comic book heroes, but they're certainly not of that kind. Instead, they deal with drugs; Saul is Dale's supplier, and as much as Saul would like to think of Dale as a buddy, Dale wants nothing else to do with him outside of the service he provides. However, after Dale witnesses a murder involving some drug-dealer crimelords, the two are forced to embark on a journey that will have them at odds with each other whether they like it or not. What results of this is a story of friendship, and while the unlikely premise of these guys not exactly getting along does seem a bit shifty, the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is superb enough to allow their characters plenty of growing. To be sure, this isn't a hallmark drama, there are no grandeur statements and no tears are provoked from director David Gordon Green but that's what makes it lovable; it's a story about two regular guys, who get into crazy shenanigans, smoke weed and crack some jokes. It's not enlightening per se, but it's entertaining, and down to earth.This is where Pineapple Express begins to take the lead in front of its predecessors, as it actually attempts to tell a compelling story with an undoubtedly overblown amount of action, but with grounded drama to bear the weight of its fabrications. Through this fusion of solid characterisation with a ridiculous but conceivable action-packed plot, the film succeeds in creating an engagingly entertaining experience that doesn't just provide excitement and memorable characters, but also manages to tickle the funny bone just as frequently.Coming from the three guys who last year blessed the screen with the hilarious Superbad, Pineapple Express is a riot start to finish, combining lots of blunt dialogue with slapstick and farce to great effect in ways which made the aforementioned creation as funny as it was. It has to be said that this time around, the pacing isn't quite as tight, and the script's insistence on some scenes' ability to sustain laughter is a little off, and this in turn leads to the movie's only real technical fault. In such moments, jokes will be drawn out for long stretches of time, losing momentum, yet thankfully such scenes are far and few between, and with the pace heightening the more film reaches the conclusion; the frequency sharply decreases with time. Nevertheless, if you don't mind profane dialogue, blunt jokes and plenty of passive violence used mainly for comic effect, then Pineapple Express should please any desire for laughter that you may have.And that's all it basically comes down to, but what else were you expecting? As a movie, Pineaple Express is an entertaining and at times sweet take on friendship based around two very down to earth characters that most people should be able to relate to in some way or another. As a duo, Rogan and Franco are extremely well matched, with the interplay between the two coming off as naturally comical and aptly delivered to the point of satisfying the movie's biggest pulling point and focus. With some great action scenes tinged with plenty of comedy, all revolving around some memorable characters portrayed by enthusiastic, suitably cast performers who end up within a plot which is admittedly hammy, but fun all the same; Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh, and it does so with enough frequency to make this one of this year's greater comedies.Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)helpful•2823OtobokeSep 10, 2008Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ23How long is Pineapple Express?Powered by AlexaIs ""Pineapple Express"" based on a book?What is the song from the trailer?How could Red survive after everything that happened to him?DetailsEditRelease dateAugust 6, 2008 (United States)Countries of originUnited StatesRussiaNorth KoreaOfficial siteSony Pictures (United States)LanguagesEnglishCantoneseKoreanAlso known asPiña expressFilming locationsNorth Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USAProduction companiesColumbia PicturesRelativity MediaApatow ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$27,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$87,341,380Opening weekend US & Canada$23,245,025Aug 10, 2008Gross worldwide$101,624,843See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 51 minutesColorColorBlack and WhiteSound mixDolby DigitalDTSSDDSDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to Pineapple Express (2008) in Mexico?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

All this drove up the costs of what should have been a simple, straightforward Western; in fact, they spiraled so much that Paramount approached Howard Hughes about taking on the property, but he declined. He changed his mind when he saw a rough cut and offered to buy the film on the spot. This made Paramount rethink its strategy--originally it was going to release it as a ""B"" picture but then decided it should be one of the studio's flagship films of the year. This proved to be a good decision, as the film was a major success and easily recouped its inflated budget.GoofsIn the opening scene when Shane rides a horse down the hill, Teton Pass Highway is visible in the background.QuotesShane: I gotta be going on.Joey: Why, Shane?Shane: A man has to be what he is, Joey. Can't break the mould. I tried it and it didn't work for me.Joey: We want you, Shane.Shane: Joey, there's no living with... with a killing. There's no going back from one. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand sticks. There's no going back. Now you run on home to your mother, and tell her... tell her everything's all right. And there aren't any more guns in the valley.Joey: Shane...[Joey notices that Shane is wounded] Joey: It's bloody! You're hurt!Shane: [Shane starts to stroke Joey's hair] I'm all right, Joey. You go home to your mother and father and grow up to be strong and straight. And, Joey... take care of them, both of them.Joey: Yes, Shane.[Shane rides off] Crazy creditsIntroducing
Brandon De WildeAlternate versionsThe film was shot in Academy Ratio (1.33:1 or 4:3), but this was done around the time widescreen filmmaking was coming around. As such, many theatres cropped the film into a widescreen ratio to take advantage of this, with many DVDs being cropped as well. The 2013 Blu-ray Disc release is in the proper Academy Ratio.ConnectionsEdited into Go West, Young Man! (2003)SoundtracksAbide With Me(uncredited)Music by William H. Monk (1861)Hymn by Henry F. Lyte (1847)Played on piano and sung by many at a meetingAlso played and sung at a funeralUser reviews356ReviewReviewFeatured review8/10 A Fine Western from Days Gone ByThis film begins with a retired gunslinger by the name of ""Shane"" (Alan Ladd) riding up to a small house somewhere in Wyoming to get some water. Although the owner of the ranch house ""Joe Starrett"" (Van Heflin) initially has no problem with this, his hospitality changes when some other cowboys are seen in the horizon riding toward him causing him to suspect that Shane is part of this group of men who have been harassing him and other settlers in the area. However, it's during the subsequent altercation with these men that Joe realizes that he has judged Shane wrongly and hires him to help out as a ranch hand. But what neither Shane nor Joe fully comprehend is just how badly a cattle baron by the name of ""Rufus Ryker"" (Emile Meyer) wants every last settler out of the area. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is one of the best Western films made during this particular time period due in large part to the new wide screen technique which captured the beautiful Wyoming scenery along with a couple of graphic scenes of violence enhanced by certain innovations which were introduced to audiences worldwide. Naturally, the special effects are much more advanced now but even so this film was not only enjoyable but clearly ahead of its time as well and for those reasons I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.helpful•110Uriah43May 29, 2019Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ24How long is Shane?Powered by AlexaWhat is ""Shane"" about?Is ""Shane"" based on a book?In what time period is ""Shane"" set?DetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 6, 1954 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asGeorge Stevens' Production of ShaneFilming locationsGrand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USAProduction companyParamount PicturesSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$3,100,000 (estimated)See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 58 minutesAspect ratio1.37 : 1(original aspect ratio)Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Shane (1953) officially released in India in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.helpful•29163darkraven_109Apr 17, 2011Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateJune 9, 2011 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesCanadaFranceGermanyOfficial siteFilm SözlükLanguageEnglishAlso known asMật Mã GốcFilming locationsCité du Cinéma, Montréal, Québec, Canada(Studio)Production companiesSummit EntertainmentVendome PicturesStudioCanalSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$32,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$54,712,227Opening weekend US & Canada$14,812,094Apr 3, 2011Gross worldwide$147,332,697See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 33 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDTSDolby SRAspect ratio1.85 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.In the late '90s, Jim Carrey decided he'd had enough of playing the silly goofball and started on a path to more serious films like ""The Truman Show."" Ten years later, he's had his share of hits, but for the most part, his comedic efforts have fallen flat. Excusing 2003's fairly enjoyable ""Bruce Almighty"", Carrey hasn't had much recent success with the genre that he once dominated (""Fun with Dick and Jane"", anyone?).In ""Yes Man"", the skilled physical comedian has dusted off the cobwebs and is back in good form. Carrey really seems to be enjoying himself, putting on his best game face and immersing himself in the sight gags and slapstick madness that were so commonplace in his earlier films. He hasn't lost his touch or his talent at making people laugh, and he makes sure that the audience knows it.Truthfully, the plot to ""Yes Man"" is irrelevant. Carl Allen (Carrey), a man afraid of living life, challenges himself to say 'yes' to everything for an entire year. Hilarity ensues and in the end, everyone learns a lesson. It's nothing more than a vehicle to showcase Carrey's ability. But really, which one of his comedies isn't? There are no unexpected twists or surprise endings, just Jim Carrey doing what Jim Carrey does best. Everything else is secondary.The film is rounded out rather nicely by a few of its supporting players. Zooey Deschanel is a cute and bubbly romantic interest who even adds a bit of mayhem to the proceedings, instead of being relegated to straight-man status. ""Flight of the Conchords'"" Rhys Darby shines as Carl's Harry Potter-obsessed co-worker. However, some of the cast feels extraneous. Bradley Cooper and ""That '70s Show's"" Danny Masterson are given little to do, and contribute little as a result. The missed opportunities are irksome, but will do little to affect one's enjoyment of the film.""Yes Man"" is a fun time waiting to be had for those who know what to expect. The movie is generally funny throughout, but not clever or inventive enough to justify a second look. It's the kind of entertainment that leaves you chuckling, but won't be remembered long after viewing. The biggest thing going for the film is that it has re-energized Jim Carrey. He's an absolute joy to watch; one only wishes that ""Yes Man"" could keep up with him.Final Grade: C+helpful•2514MasterDebator5Mar 14, 2009Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ2Is this movie based on a book?How closely does the movie follow the novel?DetailsEditRelease dateJanuary 8, 2009 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesUnited KingdomOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial site (Japan)LanguagesEnglishKoreanAlso known asĐàn Ông Đúng NghĩaFilming locationsMemorial Stadium - 10th Street and Stadium Drive, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA(b-roll)Production companiesWarner Bros.Village Roadshow PicturesHeyday FilmsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$70,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$97,690,976Opening weekend US & Canada$18,262,471Dec 21, 2008Gross worldwide$223,241,637See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 44 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDTSSDDSAspect ratio2.35 : 12.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit page

The 2nd issue DVD corrected this and the two can be identified by the following..... 1. If the DVD states 2.0 Surround in the Audio Box on the reverse of the sleeve then this is the cut version and the commentary does not work. 2.

Ford in March 2017
Harrison Ford is an American actor who has had a long and varied career in the entertainment industry across seven different decades. Ford made his film debut in 1966 and spent most of the first ten years of his career in small supporting roles in both films and television before rising to stardom for his portrayal of the iconic and heroic character Han Solo in the epic space opera films Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), and then again 32 years later in The Force Awakens (2015) and The Rise of Skywalker (2019). In the early 1980s, his career soared to even bigger heights when he claimed the starring role of another heroic character Indiana Jones in the adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), a role he reprised in The Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989), The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), and The Dial of Destiny (2023). He has also famously portrayed two literary characters brought to the silver screen: the anti-hero detective Rick Deckard in the neo-noir dystopian science fiction film Blade Runner (1982) and its sequel 35 years later, Blade Runner 2049 (2017), and CIA analyst Jack Ryan in the spy thrillers Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994).
Ford also played a small role in the acclaimed war film Apocalypse Now in 1979 before becoming a very high-profile movie star in leading roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s with such films as the romantic dramatic thriller Witness with Kelly McGillis for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, the romantic comedy-drama Working Girl with Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver, the recovery drama Regarding Henry with Annette Bening, the man-on-the-run action-thriller The Fugitive with Tommy Lee Jones, and the romantic comedy-drama remake Sabrina with Julia Ormond, earning Golden Globe nominations for the latter two films.
In 1997, Ford starred as fictional U.S. President James Marshall opposite Gary Oldman in the political action-thriller Air Force One and then went on to play Russian submarine Captain Alexei Vostrikov opposite Liam Neeson in the Cold War-era thriller K-19: The Widowmaker in 2002, a film based on true events in which he also served as executive producer. He continued to diversify his choice of roles throughout the 2000s and 2010s, transitioning from leading man to character actor with such parts as cantankerous newsman Mike Pomeroy in the romantic comedy Morning Glory with Rachel McAdams and Diane Keaton, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde in the science fiction/western hybrid Cowboys & Aliens with Daniel Craig, real-life Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey in the historical sports drama 42 with Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson, the no-nonsense Colonel Hyrum Graff in the science fiction adaptation of Orson Scott Card's novel Ender's Game with Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis, and the wounded aging lover William Jones in the romantic drama The Age of Adaline with Blake Lively and Ellen Burstyn. In 2019, Ford had his first voice performance in the animated film The Secret Life of Pets 2, and starred as John Thornton in an adaptation of Jack London's 1903 novel The Call of the Wild in 2020. In 2022, Ford was announced to have been selected by Marvel Studios to replace the late William Hurt as Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross in the upcoming 2024 films Captain America: Brave New World and Thunderbolts, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
In addition to feature films and television, Ford has also narrated and participated in several documentaries.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.helpful•264104justdialreadyOct 27, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inThe Year in PostersThe Year in PostersFrom John Wick: Chapter 4 to ""Ahsoka,"" take a look back at some of our favorite posters of 2023.See the galleryPhotosFAQ18How long is Five Nights at Freddy's?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 26, 2023 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial InstagramLanguageEnglishAlso known asBad CupcakeFilming locationsOakwood Center, Terrytown, Louisiana, USA(Mall)Production companiesUniversal PicturesBlumhouse ProductionsScott Cawthon ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$20,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$137,275,620Opening weekend US & Canada$80,001,720Oct 29, 2023Gross worldwide$289,361,620See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 49 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.00 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat was the official certification given to Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) in France?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

Forever Changed Animated Film 💯This is as close to perfection as any animated film has come, entertained parents on a equal plane with their children, and set the bar to the top of the animation film industry. No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors.

3889303340774028,2,"Well, since you're watching with your friend, and not your parents, is it okay if I recommend an R-rated movie?  

If so, I would recommend the 2014 movie, Whiplash.  It stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons.  It's not a light-hearted movie, but it is arguably a coming-of-age drama, and it is not too depressing.  It's a movie about a music student who starts to attend an elite music school, specializing in jazz drumming, and his quest to become a great jazz drummer and win the favor of his overbearing professor, who is played by J.K. Simmons.  

Does that sound like a good movie to watch that on an airplane?

3889303340774028,2,"Well, since you're watching with your friend, and not your parents, is it okay if I recommend an R-rated movie?  

If so, I would recommend the 2014 movie, Whiplash.  It stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons.  It's not a light-hearted movie, but it is arguably a coming-of-age drama, and it is not too depressing.  It's a movie about a music student who starts to attend an elite music school, specializing in jazz drumming, and his quest to become a great jazz drummer and win the favor of his overbearing professor, who is played by J.K. Simmons.  

Does that sound like a good movie to watch that on an airplane?

Whiplash is a 2014 American independent psychological drama  film written and directed by Damien Chazelle, starring Miles Teller, J. K. Simmons, Paul Reiser, and Melissa Benoist. The film follows the ambitious music student and aspiring jazz drummer Andrew Neiman (Teller), who is pushed to his limit by his abusive instructor Terence Fletcher (Simmons) at the fictitious Shaffer Conservatory in New York City. 
The film was produced by Bold Films, Blumhouse Productions, and Right of Way Films. Sony Pictures acquired distribution rights for most of the world, releasing the film under its Sony Pictures Classics and Stage 6 Films banners for its North American and international releases, respectively.[3][4]
Chazelle finished writing the script in 2013, drawing upon his experiences in a ""very competitive"" jazz band in high school. Soon after, Right of Way and Blumhouse helped Chazelle turn 15 pages of the script into an 18-minute short film, also titled Whiplash. The short film received acclaim after debuting at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, which attracted investors to produce the complete version of the script. Filming took place in September 2013 throughout Los Angeles in the course of 20 days. The film explores concepts of perfectionism, dedication, and success and deconstructs the concept of ambition.
Whiplash premiered in competition at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 16, 2014, as the festival's opening film; it won the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize for drama.[5] The film opened in limited release domestically in the United States and Canada on October 10, 2014, gradually expanding to over 500 screens and finally closing on March 26, 2015. The film received widespread acclaim for its screenplay, direction, film editing, sound mixing, and Teller's and Simmons's performances, and grossed $49 million on a $3.3 million budget, making it Chazelle's highest grossing feature until La La Land (2016). The film received multiple awards and nominations, winning Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and also being nominated for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. Simmons's portrayal of Fletcher won him the Academy, BAFTA, Critics' Choice, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild awards for Best Supporting Actor. It has since been cited as one of the best films of the 2010s and the 21st century.[6][7][8][9][10]


Plot[edit]
Andrew Neiman is a first-year student and jazz drummer at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York City, hoping one day to leave a legacy like that of his childhood idol, jazz drummer Buddy Rich. Terence Fletcher, the conductor of the Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band, recruits him to play in the Studio ensemble as an alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner. Andrew quickly discovers that Fletcher is relentlessly strict, emotionally manipulative, and abusive to his students; he throws a chair at Andrew and then slaps and berates him for failing to keep tempo during the ensemble's rehearsal of Hank Levy's titular piece, ""Whiplash"".
Determined to impress Fletcher, Andrew intensifies his drum practicing, oftentimes until the blisters on his hands bleed. After their first set at a jazz competition, Andrew misplaces Tanner's sheet music. Since Tanner cannot play without the sheets, Andrew replaces him for the next set and does it from memory. After a successful performance of ""Whiplash"", Fletcher promotes Andrew to the core drummer. However, Andrew is taken aback when Fletcher abruptly gives the position to Ryan Connolly, a drummer from a lower-level ensemble within Shaffer. Because of his single-mindedness towards music, Andrew's relationship with his family deteriorates, and he breaks up with his girlfriend, Nicole, to focus on his ambitions. After a grueling five-hour practice session with Tanner and Connolly on ""Caravan"" in which Fletcher demands them to play at the fastest possible tempo, Andrew earns back the core position.
On the way to the next competition, Andrew's bus gets a flat tire. He rents a car but arrives late and forgets his sticks at the rental office. After convincing an impatient Fletcher to wait for him, Andrew races back and retrieves them, but is hit by a truck on the way back. Andrew crawls from the wreckage and runs to the theater, arriving with a face covered in blood and a ripped suit just as the ensemble enters the stage. Heavily injured, he struggles to play ""Caravan"", and Fletcher halts the performance to dismiss him from the band. Enraged, Andrew attacks Fletcher onstage but is pulled away by security and expelled from Shaffer.
At his father's request, Andrew meets a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey, a former student of Fletcher's. Though Fletcher had claimed Casey died in a car accident, he actually had hanged himself due to depression and anxiety allegedly caused by Fletcher's abuse. Casey's parents want Fletcher held accountable, and Andrew reluctantly agrees to testify anonymously, leading Shaffer to terminate Fletcher.
Andrew subsequently abandons drumming, but months later he encounters Fletcher playing piano at a jazz club. Over a drink, Fletcher admits his teaching methods were harsh but argues they were necessary to motivate his students to become successful, citing an incident in Charlie Parker's rise to fame as an example. He invites Andrew to perform with his band at the JVC Jazz Festival, assuring him that the songs will be the same ones played by the Studio Band; Andrew hesitantly accepts. Andrew calls Nicole to invite her to the performance but finds out she is in a new relationship.
Onstage at JVC, before the first piece, Fletcher confronts Andrew and reveals he knows Andrew testified against him. As revenge, Fletcher leads the band into a song Andrew does not know and was not provided the sheet music for. After a disastrous performance, Andrew walks offstage humiliated. After being hugged backstage by his father, Andrew returns to the stage, retakes the drum kit, and cuts off Fletcher's introduction to the next piece by launching into the drum intro to ""Caravan"", cueing the band himself. Initially angered, Fletcher resumes conducting. As the piece finishes, Andrew continues into an unexpected extended solo. Impressed, Fletcher nods in approval before cueing the finale.

Production[edit]
While attending Princeton High School, writer-director Damien Chazelle was in the ""very competitive"" Studio Band and drew on the dread he felt in those years.[11] He based the conductor, Terence Fletcher, on his former band instructor (who died in 2003) but ""pushed it further"", adding elements of Buddy Rich and other band leaders known for their harsh treatment.[11] Chazelle said he wrote the film ""initially in frustration"" while trying to get his musical La La Land off the ground.[12]
Right of Way Films and Blumhouse Productions helped Chazelle turn 15 pages of his original screenplay into a short film starring Johnny Simmons as Neiman and J. K. Simmons (no relation)[13] as Fletcher.[14] The 18-minute short film received acclaim after debuting at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, winning the short film Jury Award for fiction,[15] which attracted investors to produce the complete version of the script.[16] The feature-length film was financed for $3.3 million by Bold Films.[3]
In August 2013, Miles Teller signed on to star in the role originated by Johnny Simmons; J. K. Simmons remained attached to his original role.[17] Early on, Chazelle gave J. K. Simmons direction that ""I want you to take it past what you think the normal limit would be,"" telling him: ""I don't want to see a human being on-screen any more. I want to see a monster, a gargoyle, an animal."" Many of the band members were real musicians or music students, and Chazelle tried to capture their expressions of fear and anxiety when Simmons pressed them. Chazelle said that, in between takes, Simmons was ""as sweet as can be"", which he credits for keeping ""the shoot from being nightmarish"".[11]
Principal photography began in September 2013, with filming taking place throughout Los Angeles, including the Hotel Barclay, Palace Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre.[18][19] The film was shot in 20 days, with a schedule of 14 hours of filming per day.[20] Chazelle was involved in a serious car accident in the third week of shooting and was hospitalized with possible concussion, but he returned to set the next day to finish the film on time.[20]
Having taught himself to play drums at age 15, Teller performed much of the drumming seen in the film. Supporting actor and jazz drummer Nate Lang, who plays Teller's rival Carl in the film, trained Teller in the specifics of jazz drumming; this included changing his grip from ""matched"" to ""traditional"".[21] For certain scenes, professional drummer Kyle Crane served as Teller's drum double.[22][23]

Music[edit]
Main article: Whiplash (soundtrack)
The soundtrack album was released on October 7, 2014, via Varèse Sarabande label.[24] The soundtrack consists of 24 tracks divided in three different parts: original jazz pieces written for the film, original underscore parts written for the film, and classic jazz standards written by Stan Getz, Duke Ellington, and other musicians. The actual drummer was Bernie Dresel.[25]
On March 27, 2020, an expanded deluxe edition was released on double CD and 2-LP gatefold sleeve vinyl with new cover art, and featured original music by Justin Hurwitz, plus bonus track and remixes by Timo Garcia, Opiuo, Murray A. Lightburn and more.[26]

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]
In North America, the film opened in a limited release on October 10, 2014, in 6 theaters, grossing $135,388 ($22,565 per theater) and finishing 34th at the box office.[2] It expanded to 88 locations, then 419 locations.[27] After three months on release it had earned $7 million, and finally expanded nationwide to 1000 locations to capitalize on receiving five Academy Awards nominations.[28] Whiplash grossed $13.1 million in the U.S. and Canada and $35.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $49 million against a budget of $3.3 million.[2]

Critical response[edit]
Director Damien Chazelle at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film scored 94% based on 307 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site's critical consensus states, ""Intense, inspiring, and well-acted, Whiplash is a brilliant sophomore effort from director Damien Chazelle and a riveting vehicle for stars J. K. Simmons and Miles Teller.""[29] On Metacritic the film has a score of 89 out of 100, based on reviews from 49 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[30] Simmons received wide praise for his performance and won the 2015 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[31][32]
Peter Debruge, in his review for Variety, said that the film ""demolishes the cliches of the musical-prodigy genre, investing the traditionally polite stages and rehearsal studios of a topnotch conservatory with all the psychological intensity of a battlefield or sports arena.""[33] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the performances of Teller and Simmons, writing: ""Teller, who greatly impressed in last year's Sundance entry The Spectacular Now, does so again in a performance that is more often simmering than volatile ... Simmons has the great good fortune for a character actor to have here found a co-lead part he can really run with, which is what he excitingly does with a man who is profane, way out of bounds and, like many a good villain, utterly compelling.""[34] Whiplash also won the 87th Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing and the 87th Academy Award for Best Film Editing.[35]
Amber Wilkinson of The Daily Telegraph praised the direction and editing, writing: ""Chazelle's film has a sharp and gripping rhythm, with shots beautifully edited by Tom Cross... often cutting to the crash of Andrew's drums.""[36] James Rocchi of Indiewire gave a positive review and said, ""Whiplash is ... full of bravado and swagger, uncompromising where it needs to be, informed by great performances and patient with both its characters and the things that matter to them.""[37] Henry Barnes of The Guardian gave the film a positive review, calling it a rare film ""about music that professes its love for the music and its characters equally.""[35]
Forrest Wickman of Slate said the film distorted jazz history and promoted a misleading idea of genius, adding that ""In all likelihood, Fletcher isn't making a Charlie Parker. He's making the kind of musician that would throw a cymbal at him.""[38] In The New Yorker, Richard Brody said,""Whiplash honors neither jazz nor cinema.""[39]

Accolades[edit]
Main article: List of accolades received by Whiplash
The film received the top audience and grand jury awards in the U.S. dramatic competition at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival;[44] Chazelle's short film of the same name took home the jury award in the U.S. fiction category one year prior.[15] The film also took the grand prize and the audience award for its favorite film at the 40th Deauville American Film Festival.[45]
Whiplash was originally planned to compete for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, but on January 6, 2015, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) announced that the film would instead be competing in the Adapted Screenplay category[46] to the surprise of many including Chazelle,[47] due to the short film premiering at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival (one year before the feature film's release), even though the feature film's script was written first and the short was made to attract investors into producing the feature-length film.[14] Although the Writers Guild of America categorized the screenplay as original, AMPAS classed it as an adaptation of the 2013 short version.[47]
At the 87th Academy Awards, J. K. Simmons received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, Tom Cross won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing and Craig Mann, Ben Wilkins and Thomas Curley won the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing. In December 2015, the score received a Grammy nomination, and the film was nominated for the NME Award for Best Film.[citation needed]
In 2020, it ranked 13 on Empire's list of ""The 100 Greatest Movies Of The 21st Century.""[48]

As a nod to Angoulême's comic heritage, the sequences were done entirely by local illustrators. The team comprised a maximum of 15 people, using The Adventures of Tintin and Blake and Mortimer as their main inspirations. The process took about seven months to complete.GoofsDuring the interview, Roebuck Wright's jacket chest pockets are unbuttoned and then buttoned after cut.QuotesRoebuck Wright: Maybe with good luck we'll find what eluded us in the places we once called home.Crazy creditsCovers of different issues of The French Dispatch accompany the first few minutes of the ending credits.ConnectionsFeatured in What 16 Movies Looked Like Behind the Scenes in 2021 (2021)SoundtracksBouree Sur Place & Forward (Waltz in C# Minor from Les Sylphides)Written by Frédéric ChopinPerformed by Steven MitchellCourtesy of Danceables RecordsUser reviews662ReviewReviewFeatured review7/10 love Moses and SimoneKansas Evening Sun is closing with the death of its editor. It has a foreign bureau in post-war Paris run by Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray) who has cultivated a stable of eccentric writers. This follows three of the articles. This is a Wes Anderson film.This has the Wes Anderson cohorts with a few new members. The style is all him and I love it. I love Moses and Simone. I really like the first story. I wouldn't mind if that's the whole movie. The second story is interesting but Wes is essentially taking pot shots at young idealistic protesters. I kept thinking that some younger viewers are going yell out Boomer at the screen. It's trying to be humorous but it's missing that other point of view. The third story is the least interesting to me. I'm not sure if it's the structure or the actual story. I really lost interest by that point. I wish that this is a whole movie about Moses and his artistic adventures.helpful•11543SnoopyStyleDec 18, 2021Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign in24 Frames From Wes Anderson Films24 Frames From Wes Anderson FilmsExplore the memorable career of Wes Anderson through 24 stills from his movies.See the galleryPhotosFAQ21How long is The French Dispatch?Powered by AlexaWhen is the release date?What happened to Kate Winslet?

That the director turned this most devastating of stories into a riveting pop culture phenomenon without ceding one inch on its tragic dimensions is surely an achievement for the ages.

What he [Nolan] has put before our eyes definitively deserves to be seen, as does Cillian Murphy's performance in the role of Oppenheimer and the irreconcilable but fantastic Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Lewis Strauss. [Full review in Spanish]

This is a complex look at a complicated man, but Oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling -- and that Nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it.

Every scene feels like a cataclysm waiting to happen, fitting for a film that builds, step-by-step, to the creation of a cataclysm machine. Oppenheimer both summons awe for what it took to build the bomb and for the changes it wrought.

Nolan wallows in lazy, glib filmmaking, designed to turn the incineration of hundreds of thousands into a mellow, righteous glow of self-congratulation.

Everything is Horrible (Substack)
While Nolan brings the full weight of his filmmaking talent to bear on the film, it is actually the performances that stand out the most.

I was uncomfortable watching yet another film about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocities glossed over by Oppenheimer had no voice.

That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things.helpful•23782ccthemovieman-1Jan 17, 2007Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inOur Favorite Female DetectivesOur Favorite Female DetectivesWhether they're amature sleuths or seasoned professionals, these women are some of the best detectives to hit the screen.See the galleryPhotosFAQ20Why do Dr Chilton and Barney make a point of telling Clarice not to touch or approach the glass housing Dr Lecter?

The Wedding Singer is a 1998 American romantic comedy film directed by Frank Coraci, written by Tim Herlihy, and produced by Robert Simonds and Jack Giarraputo. The film stars Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Christina Pickles and Christine Taylor, and tells the story of a wedding singer in 1985 who falls in love with a waitress. The film was released on February 13, 1998. Produced on a budget of US$18 million, it grossed $123 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics. It is often ranked as one of Sandler's best comedies.
The film was later adapted into a stage musical of the same name, debuting on Broadway in April 2006 and closing on New Year's Eve of that same year. Jon Lovitz would reprise his role as Jimmie Moore in the episode of the same name of The Goldbergs, set during the events of The Wedding Singer, with Sandler,  Barrymore and Billy Idol appearing through the use of archival footage. The film marks the first collaboration between Sandler and Barrymore, and is followed by 50 First Dates and Blended (the latter also directed by Coraci).


Plot[edit]
Robbie Hart is a wedding singer in Ridgefield, New Jersey in 1985, whose own wedding to his fiancée Linda is approaching. He meets and befriends Julia Sullivan, a new waitress at the reception hall where he works, and promises to sing at her wedding, though her fiancé, businessman and bond investor Glenn Gulia, has yet to set a date.
On Robbie's wedding day, his sister Kate informs him as he waits at the altar that Linda has changed her mind about the wedding, leaving him humiliated and emotionally devastated. Later that day, Linda visits Robbie and reveals that she fell in love with him for his ambitions of being a rock star, and hates the idea of being married to just a wedding singer. Robbie sinks into depression, causing his friends and family to be concerned. His best friend Sammy convinces him to return to work, but he gives a depressed performance that is panned, and decides to give up wedding gigs and reneges on his promise to sing for Julia when Glenn finally sets a date. However, Julia convinces him to help her with the planning and their friendship blossoms. During a double date with Julia, Glenn, and Julia's cousin Holly, Robbie learns from Glenn that he cheats on Julia frequently and plans to continue after they are married.
Julia and Robbie are increasingly confused by their deepening feelings for each other. When Holly tells Robbie that Julia is marrying Glenn for his money, he unsuccessfully pursues a job at a bank. Julia is dismayed at his materialism, and when he accuses her of the same, she becomes angry with him. Depressed, he decides to follow Sammy's example of only having shallow relationships with women, in response to which Sammy confides that he is unhappy, and encourages Robbie to tell Julia how he feels. Meanwhile, Julia confides in her mother that she has fallen out of love with Glenn and has developed feelings for Robbie, and bursts into tears thinking about becoming ""Mrs. Julia Gulia"". Robbie arrives to declare his feelings, and sees her through her bedroom window in her wedding dress, where she is happily looking in a mirror pretending she has just married Robbie, but Robbie assumes she is thinking of Glenn.
Heartbroken, Robbie leaves to get drunk and finds Glenn in the midst of his pre-wedding bachelor party, arm in arm with another woman. After a heated exchange, Glenn punches Robbie and mocks him. Robbie stumbles home to find Linda waiting for him wanting to reconcile, and passes out. The following morning, she answers the door and introduces herself as his fiancée to a crestfallen Julia. She runs to Glenn, who is sleeping off the events of the previous night, and tells him she wants to be married immediately. He half-heartedly offers to take her to Las Vegas.
Robbie awakens and, after shaking off his hangover from the previous night, rejects Linda's reconciliation, having realized how shallow she is during his time with Julia, and kicks her out. At the 50th wedding anniversary party of his neighbor Rosie, to whom he has been giving singing lessons, he realizes he wants to grow old with Julia and, with Rosie's encouragement, he decides to pursue her. Just then, Holly arrives and informs him of Julia's encounter with Linda, so Robbie rushes to the airport and gets a first class ticket to Las Vegas.
After telling his story to his empathetic fellow passengers, which include Billy Idol, he learns that Glenn and Julia are on the same flight. With the help of Billy and the flight crew, over the loudspeaker, he sings a song he has written called ""Grow Old With You"", dedicated to Julia. As Robbie enters the main cabin singing, Glenn tries to assault him only to be thwarted and shoved into a lavatory by the flight attendants with assistance from Billy and a large fan. Robbie and Julia admit their love for each other, and share a kiss. Billy, impressed by Robbie's song, offers to tell his record company executives about him. Later, Robbie and Julia are married, and Robbie's bandmates perform at their wedding.

Production[edit]
Adam Sandler had an idea for a comedy about a wedding singer who gets left at the altar, and suggested it to Tim Herlihy. Inspired by the radio show ""Lost in the '80s"" Herlihy decided to set the film in that decade. Herlihy had not set out to do anything different and thought the script was similar to his previous collaborations with Sandler. The changes came naturally, and he attributed the differences to his recently having gotten married, as well as the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore.[2] Herlihy was aware that Sandler's previous films had lacked a female perspective, and emphasized the importance of Barrymore. He explained that she was so great in her scenes that test audiences did not complain about Sandler not being in every scene as they had done for his previous films, and as a result more of her scenes survived and were included in the final film.[3] Carrie Fisher, a frequent script doctor, was brought on to make the female part more balanced.[4][5] Judd Apatow and Sandler also performed uncredited rewrites of the script.[5][6]
Director Frank Coraci was friends with Sandler since they went to college at NYU and could hardly believe that he and his friends had the opportunity to make films together. Coraci had also gotten over his own experiences of romantic heartbreak a few years earlier and was able to look back on it differently and instead allow it to be funny. Coraci was a fan of director John Hughes and mentioned his films as an important influence.[7]
Barrymore approached Sandler about working together on a film, saying they were ""cinematic soulmates"" before they had even worked together.[8] Barrymore had a great relationship with Coraci, and praised him for balancing the broad comedy with the important moments of emotion and intimacy. Sandler would often make Barrymore laugh out of context, so that even after a long day, her laughs on camera would be real. In addition, she would not read or hear the songs until the first shoot so that her reactions would be more spontaneous.[8]
Principal photography took place in California from February 3 to March 25, 1997.[citation needed]

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]

The film had a budget of $18 million and made $123.3 million worldwide in ticket sales.[1] It opened in second in the US with $18.8 million,[9] behind holdover Titanic.

Critical response[edit]

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""It's decidedly uneven -- and surprisingly sappy for an early Adam Sandler comedy -- but The Wedding Singer is also sweet, funny, and beguiling.""[10] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[11] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.[12]
Leonard Klady of Variety wrote: ""Director Frank Coraci and scripter Tim Herlihy work in concert to maintain a quality of farce rooted in human comedy.""[13] Roger Ebert gave the film a negative review and wrote: ""The screenplay reads like a collaboration between Jekyll and Hyde.""[14]

Boy George responded to the film, saying that when he saw Alexis Arquette doing an impersonation of him and singing ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"" he thought it was hilarious.[15][16]
The film has frequently been ranked as one of Sandler's best comedies.[17][18][19][20]

Musical adaptation[edit]
Main article: The Wedding Singer (musical)
In 2006, a musical adaption of the same name was released on Broadway starring Stephen Lynch as Robbie and Laura Benanti as Julia. The show has had two national tours in 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 respectively. It was nominated for five Tony Awards and eight Drama Desk Awards and received generally good reviews. In this show, the airplane scene with Billy Idol was replaced with a scene in Las Vegas where Robbie meets a Billy Idol impersonator, and they and a group of other impersonators including Ronald Reagan, Cyndi Lauper and Imelda Marcos come to convince Julia to give up Glenn. In addition, Robbie's neighbor Rosie is changed to be his grandma with whom he lives and who asks him to write a song out of a poem she wrote for the 50th anniversary party. Also Robbie's friend, Sammy, was changed from being a limousine driver to being a part of Robbie's band. The show only ran on Broadway for 284 performances but has become a popular show among community theaters and high schools.

Daddy Day Care is a 2003 American family comedy film starring Eddie Murphy in the lead role, Jeff Garlin, Steve Zahn, Regina King, and Anjelica Huston. Written by Geoff Rodkey and directed by Steve Carr, it marks Murphy and Carr's second collaboration after Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001). The plot follows two fathers who start a child day care out of their home after they are laid off from their corporate jobs.
The film was released in the United States on May 9, 2003, by Columbia Pictures. It received generally negative reviews from critics, but grossed $164.4 million worldwide on a budget of $60 million. The movie was followed by two sequels, in the film series of the same name.


Plot[edit]
Charlie Hinton is a market executive at a local food company. He and his wife Kim have just enrolled their son Ben into Chapman Academy, an overly academic preschool overseen by the haughty Gwyneth Harridan. However, on the day they enroll him, Charlie and his best friend, Phil Ryerson(along with 300 others) are laid off when the company shuts down their division due to the poor reception of their vegetable based breakfast cereals. Charlie breaks the news to Kim and Ben at dinner, but assures them he will find a new job. 
While Kim supports the family by returning to work as a lawyer, Charlie, after six weeks of job hunting and finding nothing, is forced to take Ben out of Chapman. Unable to find a satisfactory alternative, Charlie decides to open a daycare center in his home with the help of Phil, calling it ""Daddy Day Care"". Although local parents are suspicious of men working with kids, a few choose their service as it is more affordable and child-based.
Charlie and Phil open with a few children, struggling at first with chaos and some personal issues. Angered at losing children to the new competition, Harridan attempts to shut them down by notifying child services, and Charlie and Phil find themselves rectifying problems pointed out by Dan Kubitz, a director of child services, to ensure their daycare is suitable for children, including hiring their former colleague Marvin as an additional care provider. In time, they start to enjoy running Daddy Day Care as it grows in popularity, with Charlie delighted to see Ben making friends and enjoying himself. 
When Kubitz points out that the house cannot accommodate the number of children they now have, he suggests that they either remove two kids or find a permanent facility somewhere in town. Not willing to remove any of the children, Charlie chooses the latter option. Marvin tells them of a suitable vacant building, but they cannot afford it, so they decide to hold a fundraiser to earn the necessary capital. However, Harridan learns of the event and sabotages it with help from her hesitant assistant Jennifer. As a result, Charlie and Phil do not raise enough money to pay for the building. 
At the same time, the company offers Charlie and Phil their old jobs back at double their salaries, having decided to rehire them after acting on an earlier idea that Charlie had sarcastically suggested. Harridan also offers to take in their children for a more affordable price if Daddy Day Care shuts down. Charlie and Phil reluctantly accept the offer, leaving Marvin heartbroken and refusing to join them. Ben is also disappointed when Charlie tells him he has to go back to Chapman. The next day, Charlie questions his decision after he realizes the impact Daddy Day Care has had on Ben and the other children. Deciding that Ben is the most important thing to him, he quits, convincing Phil to join him and re-open Daddy Day Care. Informing Marvin of their plans, Charlie confronts Harridan during a student orientation and reveals to the parents in attendance how little she cares about their children. After mentioning how much Daddy Day Care changed and helped the children, Charlie declares that Daddy Day Care is reopened and convinces the parents to return. 
Six months later, the daycare manages to buy the building it needs to expand and prospers, with Charlie and Phil now successful, Jennifer now working for the center, and Marvin entering a relationship with one of the parents. With Chapman no more, Harridan is forced to work as a crossing guard, but confuses the car drivers nearby when a bee harasses her because of a daisy on her vest.

The film's poster was officially released in December of that year, with the tagline, D-Day is coming.[3]

Release[edit]
Critical reception[edit]
On Rotten Tomatoes, Daddy Day Care has an approval rating of 27% based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 4.51/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Daddy Day Care does its job of babysitting the tots. Anyone older will probably be bored"".[4] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".[5] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.[6]
Todd McCarthy from Variety called it ""scarcely more amusing than spending ninety minutes in a pre K classroom"" and a ""comically undernourished junk food snack"".[7]

Box office[edit]
Despite the negative critical ratings, the film was a box office success, grossing over $160 million worldwide based on a $60 million budget.[1] The film was released in the United Kingdom on July 11, 2003, and opened at #3, behind Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Bruce Almighty.[8] The next two weekends, the film moved down one place, before finally ending up at No. 10 on August 1.[9][10][11]

Sequels[edit]
Main articles: Daddy Day Camp and Grand-Daddy Day Care
Soon after the release of Daddy Day Care, Murphy was rumored to be involved in a sequel film, although he had not signed up for one.[12] A sequel was released on August 8, 2007, titled Daddy Day Camp, with Cuba Gooding, Jr. replacing Murphy as Charlie Hinton and Sony once again distributes the film (this time under TriStar). The film was panned by critics, with a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It won the Razzie Award for ""Worst Prequel or Sequel"". Another sequel, Grand-Daddy Day Care, was released on February 5, 2019 by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on direct-to-video format. Da'Vone McDonald portrayed Charlie Hinton, who appears as a supporting character.

Gangs of New York is a 2002 American historical drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan, based on Herbert Asbury's 1927 book The Gangs of New York.[6] The film stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cameron Diaz, with Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Stephen Graham, Eddie Marsan, and Brendan Gleeson in supporting roles.
The film is set in 1863, when a long-running Catholic–Protestant feud erupts into violence, just as an Irish immigrant group is protesting against the threat of conscription. Scorsese spent twenty years developing the project until Miramax Films acquired it in 1999. Principal photography took place in Cinecittà, Rome and Long Island City, New York City.
Gangs of New York was completed by 2001 but its release was delayed due to the September 11 attacks. The film was theatrically released in the United States on December 20, 2002, and grossed over $193 million worldwide. It was met with generally positive reviews and Day-Lewis's performance was highly acclaimed. It received ten nominations at the 75th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese and Best Actor for Day-Lewis.


Plot[edit]
In the 1846 slum of the Five Points, two rival gangs, the Protestant Confederation of American Natives, led by William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting, and the Irish Catholic immigrant Dead Rabbits, led by ""Priest"" Vallon, engage in their final battle to determine which faction will hold sway over the territory. At the end of the battle, Bill kills Vallon and declares the Dead Rabbits outlawed. Having witnessed this, Vallon's young son hides the knife that killed his father and is taken to an orphanage on Blackwell's Island.
In 1862, Vallon's son, ‘Amsterdam’ returns to the Five Points seeking revenge and retrieves the knife. An old acquaintance, Johnny Sirocco, familiarizes him with the local clans of gangs, all of whom pay tribute to Bill, who remains in control of the territory. Amsterdam is introduced to Bill but keeps his past a secret as he seeks recruitment into the gang. He learns many of his father's former lieutenants are now in Bill's employ. Each year, Bill celebrates the anniversary of his victory over the Dead Rabbits and Amsterdam secretly plans to kill him publicly during this celebration. Amsterdam soon becomes attracted to pickpocket and grifter Jenny Everdeane, with whom Johnny is also infatuated. Amsterdam gains Bill's confidence and becomes his protégé, involving him in the dealings of corrupt Tammany Hall politician William M. Tweed. Amsterdam saves Bill from an assassination attempt and is tormented by the thought that he may have done so out of honest devotion.
On the evening of the anniversary, Johnny, in a fit of jealousy over Jenny's affection for Amsterdam, reveals Amsterdam's true identity and intentions to Bill. Bill baits Amsterdam with a knife throwing act involving Jenny. As Bill toasts Priest Vallon, Amsterdam throws his knife, but Bill deflects it and wounds Amsterdam with a counter throw. Bill then beats him and burns his cheek with a hot blade. Going into hiding, Jenny implores him to escape with her to San Francisco. Amsterdam, however, returns to the Five Points seeking vengeance and announces his return by hanging a dead rabbit in Paradise Square in front of several Irish gangs that were allied with the Dead Rabbits. Bill sends corrupt Irish policeman and former Dead Rabbit Mulraney to investigate, but Amsterdam garrotes him to death and hangs his body in the square. In retaliation, Bill has Johnny beaten and run through with a pike, leaving it to Amsterdam to end his suffering. When Amsterdam's gang beats McGloin, a former Dead Rabbit and one of Bill's lieutenants, Bill and the Natives march on the church and are met by Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits. No violence ensues, but Bill promises to return soon. The incident garners newspaper coverage, and Amsterdam presents Tweed with a plan to defeat Bill's influence: Tweed will back the candidacy of Monk McGinn for sheriff and Amsterdam will secure the Irish vote for Tammany. Monk wins in a landslide, and a humiliated Bill murders him. McGinn's death prompts an angry Amsterdam to challenge Bill to a gang battle in Paradise Square, which Bill accepts.
The Civil War draft riots break out just as the gangs are preparing to fight, and Union Army soldiers are deployed to control the rioters. As the rival gangs fight, cannon fire from ships is directed into Paradise Square, interrupting their battle shortly before it begins. Many of the gang members are killed by the naval gunfire, soldiers, or rioters. Bill and Amsterdam face off against one another until Bill is wounded by shrapnel. Amsterdam then uses his father's knife to kill Bill.
Amsterdam buries the knife next to his father in a cemetery in Brooklyn, erecting a makeshift headstone with the name William Cutting over it now alongside the actual tombstone of Priest Vallon. As Amsterdam and Jenny leave, the skyline changes as modern New York City is built over the next century, from the Brooklyn Bridge to the World Trade Center, and the cemetery becomes overgrown and forgotten.

Production[edit]


The country was up for grabs, and New York was a powder keg. This was the America not [of] the West with its wide open spaces, but of claustrophobia, where everyone was crushed together. On one hand, you had the first great wave of immigration, the Irish, who were Catholic, spoke Gaelic, and owed allegiance to the Vatican. On the other hand, there were the Nativists, who felt that they were the ones who had fought and bled, and died for the nation. They looked at the Irish coming off the boats and said, ""What are you doing here?"" It was chaos, tribal chaos. Gradually, there was a street by street, block by block, working out of democracy as people learned somehow to live together. If democracy didn't happen in New York, it wasn't going to happen anywhere.


— Martin Scorsese on how he saw the history of New York City as the battleground of the modern American democracy[7]

Martin Scorsese had grown up in Little Italy in the borough of Manhattan in New York City during the 1950s. At the time, he had noticed there were parts of his neighborhood that were much older than the rest, including tombstones from the 1810s in Old St. Patrick's Cathedral, cobblestone streets and small basements located under more recent large buildings; this sparked Scorsese's curiosity about the history of the area: ""I gradually realized that the Italian-Americans weren't the first ones there, that other people had been there before us. As I began to understand this, it fascinated me. I kept wondering, how did New York look? What were the people like? How did they walk, eat, work, dress?""[7]

Development[edit]
In 1970, Scorsese came across Herbert Asbury's book The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld (1927) about the city's nineteenth-century criminal underworld and found it to be a revelation. In the portraits of the city's criminals, Scorsese saw the potential for an American epic about the battle for the modern American democracy.[7] Scorsese immediately contacted his friend Jay Cocks, a film critic for Time magazine. ""Think of it like a western in outer space,"" Scorsese had told him. Cocks recalled they had considered Malcolm McDowell in the lead role and framing the narrative with quotations from Bruce Springsteen, but otherwise they intended to keep the period vernacular authentic.[8] At the time, Scorsese was a young director without prestige; by the end of the decade, with the success of crime films such as Mean Streets (1973), about his old neighborhood, and Taxi Driver (1976), he was a rising star. In June 1977, producer Alberto Grimaldi ran a two-page ad in Daily Variety, announcing the film's production with Scorsese set to direct.[9][10] That same year, Scorsese and Cocks wrote the first draft, but Scorsese decided to direct Raging Bull (1980) instead.[8]
In 1979, Scorsese acquired the screen rights to Asbury's book; however, it took twenty years to get the production moving forward. Difficulties arose with reproducing the monumental cityscape of nineteenth-century New York with the style and detail Scorsese wanted; almost nothing in New York City looked as it did in that time, and filming elsewhere was not an option.[7] In 1991, Grimaldi and Scorsese resumed development on the project with Universal Pictures on a budget of $30 million. At one point, Robert De Niro was set to portray Bill the Butcher.[10] However, the studio transferred the rights to the project to Disney in 1997, whose then-chairman Joe Roth turned down the film due to its excessive violence, which was ""not appropriate for a Disney-themed movie"".[11][1]
Scorsese took the film to Warner Bros., being contractually obligated to make a film for the studio; the film was however declined by Warner Bros. as well, and afterward declined similarly by 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).[9] Eventually, in 1999, Scorsese was able to find a partnership with Harvey Weinstein, noted producer and co-chairman of Miramax Films.[7] As the film had a large budget of nearly $100 million, Weinstein then sold international distribution rights to the project to Graham King's Initial Entertainment Group for about $65 million to secure the required funds. Shortly after, Touchstone Pictures joined Miramax in funding the film, in exchange for a portion of the proceeds from domestic distribution.[9] That same year, Cocks was retained by Scorsese for the screenplay adaptation, which underwent nine revised drafts.[12] However, Weinstein was not pleased with the shooting script and wanted other screenwriters brought in for more rewrites. To placate Weinstein, Scorsese called Cocks into a room and fired him. Telling The Globe and Mail, Cocks recalled the situation: ""You ever been fired? It's terrible. Terrible. Even if it's a job you don't like, it pisses you off, right? Well you can extrapolate from that, exponentially.""[13] Due to this, the final shooting script was not fully completed when filming began. Hossein Amini was hired and wrote the last two drafts, but he was uncredited for his work.[14][10]

Set design[edit]
In order to create the sets that Scorsese envisioned, the production was filmed at the large Cinecittà Studio in Rome, Italy. Production designer Dante Ferretti recreated over a mile of mid-nineteenth century New York buildings, consisting of a five-block area of Lower Manhattan, including the Five Points slum, a section of the East River waterfront including two full-sized sailing ships, a thirty-building stretch of lower Broadway, a patrician mansion, and replicas of Tammany Hall, a church, a saloon, a Chinese theater, and a gambling casino.[7] For the Five Points, Ferretti recreated George Catlin's 1827 painting of the area.[7]

Rehearsals and character development[edit]
Particular attention was also paid to the speech of characters, as loyalties were often revealed by their accents. The film's voice coach, Tim Monich, resisted using a generic Irish brogue and instead focused on distinctive dialects of Ireland and Great Britain. As DiCaprio's character was born in Ireland but raised in the United States, his accent was designed to be a blend of accents typical of the half-Americanized. To develop the unique, lost accents of the Yankee ""Nativists"" such as Daniel Day-Lewis's character, Monich studied old poems, ballads, newspaper articles (which sometimes imitated spoken dialect as a form of humor) and the Rogue's Lexicon, a book of underworld idioms compiled by New York's police commissioner, so that his men would be able to tell what criminals were talking about. An important piece was an 1892 wax cylinder recording of Walt Whitman reciting four lines of a poem in which he pronounced the word ""Earth"" as ""Uth"", and the ""a"" of ""an"" nasal and flat, like ""ayan"". Monich concluded that native nineteenth-century New Yorkers probably sounded something like the proverbial Brooklyn cabbie of the mid-20th century.[7]

Filming[edit]
Set of the movie at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome, Italy
Principal photography began in New York and Rome on December 18, 2000, and ended on March 30, 2001.[15] Due to the strong personalities and clashing visions of director and producer, the three-year production became a story in and of itself.[7][11][16][17] Scorsese strongly defended his artistic vision on issues of taste and length while Weinstein fought for a streamlined, more commercial version. During the delays, noted actors such as Robert De Niro and Willem Dafoe had to leave the production due to conflicts with their other productions. Costs overshot the original budget by 25 percent, bringing the total cost over $100 million.[11] The increased budget made the film vital to Miramax Films' short-term success.[16][18]

Post-production and distribution[edit]
After post-production was nearly completed in 2001, the film was delayed for over a year. The official justification was after the September 11, 2001, attacks, certain elements of the picture may have made audiences uncomfortable; the film's closing shot is a view of modern-day New York City, complete with the World Trade Center's towers, despite them having been destroyed by the attacks over a year before the film's release.[19] However, this explanation was refuted in Scorsese's own contemporary statements, where he noted that the production was still filming pick-ups even into October 2002.[16][20] The filmmakers had also considered having the towers dissolved out from the shot to acknowledge their disappearance, or remove the entire sequence altogether. It was ultimately decided to keep the towers unaltered.[21]
Weinstein kept demanding cuts to the film's length, and some of those cuts were eventually made. In December 2001, film critic Jeffrey Wells reviewed a purported workprint of the film as it existed in the fall of 2001. Wells reported the work print lacked narration, was about 20 minutes longer, and although it was ""different than the [theatrical] version ... scene after scene after scene play[s] exactly the same in both."" Despite the similarities, Wells found the work print to be richer and more satisfying than the theatrical version. While Scorsese has stated the theatrical version is his final cut, he reportedly ""passed along [the] three-hour-plus [work print] version of Gangs on tape [to friends] and confided, 'Putting aside my contractual obligation to deliver a shorter, two-hour-and-forty-minute version to Miramax, this is the version I'm happiest with,' or words to that effect.""[19]
In an interview with Roger Ebert, Scorsese clarified the real issues in the cutting of the film. Ebert notes,

His discussions with Weinstein, he said, were always about finding the length where the picture worked. When that got to the press, it was translated into fights. The movie is currently 168 minutes long, he said, and that is the right length, and that's why there won't be any director's cut — because this is the director's cut.[22]
Soundtrack[edit]
Main article: Gangs of New York: Music from the Miramax Motion Picture
Robbie Robertson supervised the soundtrack's collection of eclectic pop, folk, and neo-classical tracks.

Scorsese received both praise and criticism for historical depictions in the film. In a PBS interview for the History News Network, George Washington University Professor Tyler Anbinder said that the visuals and discrimination of immigrants in the film were historically accurate, but both the amount of violence depicted and the number of Chinese, particularly female, immigrants were greater in the film than in reality.[23][24]
Asbury's book described the Bowery Boys, Plug Uglies, True Blue Americans, Shirt Tails, and Dead Rabbits, who were named after their battle standard, a dead rabbit on a pike.[7] The book also described William Poole, the inspiration for William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting, a member of the Bowery Boys, a bare-knuckle boxer, and a leader of the Know Nothing political movement. Poole did not come from the Five Points and was assassinated nearly a decade before the Draft Riots. Both the fictional Bill and the real one had butcher shops, but Poole is not known to have killed anyone.[25][26] The book also described other famous gangsters from the era such as Red Rocks Farrell, Slobbery Jim and Hell-Cat Maggie, who filed her front teeth to points and wore artificial brass fingernails.[7]
Anbinder said that Scorsese's recreation of the visual environment of mid-19th-century New York City and the Five Points ""couldn't have been much better"".[23] All sets were built completely on the exterior stages of Cinecittà Studios in Rome.[27] By 1860, New York City had 200,000 mostly Catholic Irish immigrants[28] in a population of 800,000.[29]
According to Paul S. Boyer, ""The period from the 1830s to the 1850s was a time of almost continuous disorder and turbulence among the urban poor. The decade from 1834–1844 saw more than 200 major gang wars in New York City alone, and in other cities the pattern was similar.""[30]
As early as 1839, Mayor Philip Hone said: ""This city is infested by gangs of hardened wretches"" who ""patrol the streets making night hideous and insulting all who are not strong enough to defend themselves.""[31] The large gang fight depicted in the film as occurring in 1846 is fictional, though there was one between the Bowery Boys and Dead Rabbits in the Five Points on July 4, 1857, which is not mentioned in the film.[32] Reviewer Vincent DiGirolamo concludes that ""Gangs of New York becomes a historical epic with no change over time. The effect is to freeze ethno-cultural rivalries over the course of three decades and portray them as irrational ancestral hatreds unaltered by demographic shifts, economic cycles and political realignments.""[24]
In the film, the Draft Riots of July 1863 are depicted as both destructive and violent. Records indicate the riots resulted in more than one hundred deaths, including the lynching of 11 free African-Americans. They were especially targeted by the Irish, in part because of fears of job competition that more freed slaves would cause in the city.[33] The bombardment of the city by Navy ships offshore to quell the riots is wholly fictitious. The film references the infamous Tweed Courthouse, as ""Boss"" Tweed refers to plans for the structure as being ""modest"" and ""economical"".[citation needed]
In the film, Chinese Americans were common enough in the city to have their own community and public venues. Although Chinese people migrated to America as early as the 1840s, significant Chinese migration to New York City did not begin until 1869, the time when the transcontinental railroad was completed. The Chinese theater on Pell St. was not finished until the 1890s.[34] The Old Brewery, the overcrowded tenement shown in the movie in both 1846 and 1862–63, was actually demolished in 1852.[35]

Release[edit]
The original target release date was December 21, 2001, in time for the 2001 Academy Awards but the production overshot that goal as Scorsese was still filming.[16][20] A twenty-minute clip, billed as an ""extended preview"", debuted at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was shown at a star-studded event at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès with Scorsese, DiCaprio, Diaz and Weinstein in attendance.[20]
Harvey Weinstein then wanted the film to open on December 25, 2002, but a potential conflict with another film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Catch Me If You Can produced by DreamWorks, caused him to move the opening day to an earlier position. After negotiations between several parties, including the interests of DiCaprio, Weinstein and DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, the decision was made on economic grounds: DiCaprio did not want to face a conflict of promoting two movies opening against each other; Katzenberg was able to convince Weinstein that the violence and adult material in Gangs of New York would not necessarily attract families on Christmas. Of main concern to all involved was attempting to maximize the film's opening day, an important part of film industry economics.[16]
After three years in production, the film was released on December 20, 2002, a year after its original planned release date.[20] While the film has been released on DVD and Blu-ray, there are no plans to revisit the theatrical cut or prepare a ""director's cut"" for home video release. ""Marty doesn't believe in that"", editor Thelma Schoonmaker stated. ""He believes in showing only the finished film.""[19]
Gangs of New York was released on VHS and a 2-disc DVD July 1, 2003, the film was split on both discs. A Blu-ray version of the film was released July 1, 2008.[citation needed]

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]
The film made $77,812,000 in Canada and the United States. It also took $23,763,699 in Japan and $16,358,580 in the United Kingdom. Worldwide the film grossed a total of $193,772,504.[5]

Critical reception[edit]
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 72% based on 214 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance.""[36] Metacritic, gave the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[37] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B"" on an A+ to F scale.[38]
Roger Ebert praised the film but believed it fell short of Scorsese's best work, while his At the Movies co-host Richard Roeper called it a ""masterpiece"" and declared it a leading contender for Best Picture.[39] Paul Clinton of CNN called the film ""a grand American epic"".[40] In Variety, Todd McCarthy wrote that the film ""falls somewhat short of great film status, but is still a richly impressive and densely realized work that bracingly opens the eye and mind to untaught aspects of American history."" McCarthy singled out the meticulous attention to historical detail and production design for particular praise.[41]
Some critics were disappointed with the film, with one review on CinemaBlend feeling it was overly violent with few characters worth caring about.[42] Norman Berdichevsky of the New English Review wrote in a negative critique that some locals in Spain who had watched Gangs of New York had several anti-American beliefs ""confirmed"" afterwards, which he felt was due to the film's gratuitous violence, historical inaccuracies, and general depiction of American society ""in the worst possible light"".[43] Others felt[vague] it tried to tackle too many themes without saying anything unique about them, and that the overall story was weak.[44]
Cameron Diaz's divisive performance as Irish immigrant pickpocket Jenny Everdeane has been cited as an example of poor casting and one of the worst Irish accents in film.[45]

It's both nostalgic and fresh, a tender homage to, especially, the initial Star Wars (""Episode IV: A New Hope""), as well as a bridge to help those of us stuck in the splendor of Hoth edge into the future.

It all comes together nicely as the actors breathe vulnerability, fallibility and personality into their roles, with Daisy Ridley being quite the commanding presence. My favourite, hands down, is the cute and rotund droid BB-8.

This is easily one of the best films of 2015 and one of the best in the franchise. It features an outstanding cast with some excellent performances from the new actors joining the saga and powerfully nostalgic displays from the original members.

AUDIENCE REVIEWS FOR STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS
Nov 24, 2017
The movie re creates the nostalgia of the first original movies in the story wars saga while also creating a new set of characters. The movie has some spectacular visuals then I felt it could easily be compared to a new hope. Overall though the film was pleasurable and is a must see for the general audience.


SUPER REVIEWER
Nov 12, 2016
""That is not dead which can eternal lie"" - the immortal line from H. P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu, which has increasingly become the mantra of Hollywood executives. The seemingly endless wave of remakes, reboots, re-imaginings and redundant sequels was bound to hit the Star Wars franchise sooner or later. It took less than ten years after Revenge of the Sith brought the ghastly prequel saga to a sorry conclusion for the powers-to-be (in this case Disney) to decide that audiences would be ready for another instalment or three. Disney's acquisition of Star Wars from George Lucas, coupled with the involvement of J. J. Abrams, gave the sci-fi community and the film-going public reason to have positive expectations about this series again. Having already convinced themselves, like long-suffering Highlander fans, that things at least couldn't get any worse, the hype steadily grew as the old cast members returned and more and more details were affectionately teased. It seemed as though everyone was pinning their hopes on this film working, as though it was the last great hope that Star Wars could one day be good again. Sadly, that last great hope has ended up as just another version of A New Hope, leaving us dazzled by the modern visuals but otherwise disappointed. It's true that I was initially dismissive of Disney's decision to buy Star Wars, back in the days when I regularly wrote for WhatCulture!. It's also true that I have never been the biggest fan of Abrams, branding him ""the master of hype"" and ""our generation's Wizard of Oz"", who is capable of making flashy, tempting trailers but less capable at telling original stories. But as someone who looks upon the originals fondly - or at least acknowledges their deserved place in cinema history - I still count myself among those wanting this to be good, rather than hoping that it would fail outright. The single biggest problem with The Force Awakens is how desperately and despairingly unoriginal it is. It's positively flabbergasting how a film like this can be hailed as a masterpiece when it feels for all the world like watching a bunch of children dressing up and re-enacting their version of A New Hope. The toys may be faster, and the Death Star-that's-not-but-actually-is might be bigger, but it's still essentially A New Hope with modern-day editing. Whether you look at A New Hope as a Star Wars film or as a love letter to adventure stories, it still holds up well enough (for all its problems) to make this feel immediately superfluous. I will give Abrams some credit, in that it is one of his better behaved efforts in terms of the camerawork. There is less of the irritating lens flare that there was on Star Trek or Super 8, and the action sequences don't look like they were assembled purely for the basis of making the trailer look exciting. But that being said, it's clear that the two 'Trek films he made were essentially just practice for this. The lightspeed sequences here are almost identical to the hyperspace sequences from Star Trek Into Darkness. The presence of the older cast warrants a further comparison with 'Trek. There's a conscious effort here to bring back the original actors to give the project their blessing and pass the torch, just as in Star Trek Generations or certain episodes of The Next Generation TV series. There are some lovely moments here: the chats between Han Solo and Leia are the film's most human and emotional parts, and Mark Hamill's appearance, like an exiled King Arthur having Excalibur returned, is a nice touch. But their presence only serves to remind us how good the originals were, and adds doubt as to whether the new blood are good enough to hold things up on their own. The Force Awakens is massively derivative from the outset, both in the general movements of its plot and its specific details. Jakku is just Tatooine by any other name, BB8 is R2-D2, the plans for Luke's home are the plans for the Death Star - even the early deaths are a straight lift from Anakin's vengeful slaughter in Attack of the Clones. It scores out over that film by at least pretending to break from the mould, rather than insulting our intelligence by trying to argue that everything fits in with the existing canon. But it's ironic that a film which claims to break with the Star Wars Extended Universe has ended up borrowing so nakedly from its forebears. Not only are we in overly familiar territory, but The Force Awakens has moments where it is very unsure of itself. There are at least two occasions in the script where a dramatic situation is defused by the characters stopping to take the piss out of themselves, and both times it feels forced and underwhelming. You can't build up something as serious or significant, then slip into Spaceballs, and then back again as if nothing happened. It undercuts the stakes of the drama in a very jarring manner. Then there is the plot to consider. On top of its overt resemblance to (and invocation of) A New Hope, The Force Awakens has several moments of narrative carelessness. The biggest one is the scene with Darth Vader's helmet; we don't get any explanation as to how Kylo Ren got it, or how it survived being incinerated at the end of Return of the Jedi, it's just foisted upon us because it's a dramatic image. Additionally, the film makes us feel like Poe is dead less than 30 minutes in, and then provides no explanation for his survival when he turns up again. The original trilogy had plot problems too, but at least the big stuff was explained away sufficiently to maintain our suspension of disbelief. This lack of complete care translates into the character construction as well. Rey as a character is a welcome addition to the franchise; Daisy Ridley makes the character fun and appealing, her interplay with Finn is amusing and well-written, and she is undisputedly the lead for two thirds of her screentime. But having started on so strong a footing, the filmmakers chicken out about halfway through and turn her into a damsel in distress whom Finn has to rescue. It's all well and good that Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan wanted to make Star Wars more diverse and equal ops, but surely the more interesting angle would be for Rey to use the Force to rescue Finn? The character disappointment also seeps through into the villains, which range from good to bafflingly timid. At the good end, we have General Hux; Domhnall Gleeson gives a committed and ambitious performance, believably conveying someone who is power mad and intimidating. In the middle is Snoke, realised by Andy Serkis; it's fine, though at this stage it's little more than Palpatine's appearance in The Empire Strikes Back with snazzier graphics. And then, at the bad end, we have Kylo Ren, who is little short of pitiful as a villain. As much as the trailers tried to make him threatening, he's ultimately just Darth Helmet, trying to be all big and terrifying but coming across as anything but. As Sylvester Stallone found out in Judge Dredd, walking around with a bucket on your head stops being scary if you're just going to keep taking it off. In the climactic lightsaber duel in the snow, his long hair and gormless expression may him look like a wetter, less capable version of Prince Caspian from The Chronicles of Narnia, and the film's attempts to set up daddy issues with Luke feel very half-baked. Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is a disappointing and derivative start to the new Star Wars trilogy. It cuts the mustard as two hours of empty popcorn fun, and it is slightly better written than Revenge of the Sith, but after all the hype and promise it needed to be a whole lot better. The involvement of Looper director Rian Johnson in the upcoming Episode VIII does leave some cause for hope, just as The Empire Strikes Back managed to improve by having a different director. But putting that and Rogue One out of our minds for a moment, this film remains staggeringly mediocre.

Sometimes this movie just feels like it's pandering to the fans of old. However, this movie has serious chops. It has top-notch character development and story building. I mean of course, it's a Star Wars picture so it's kind of expected. The action is good, the characters are cool. Everything is really good, even the extremely emo main villain. Nothing is obvious or expected, everything is beautifully original and amazing. You can enjoy this one if you are a fan of the original series or you can just jump right in. Check it out and I know you will like it. Good job JJ.

Midsommar is a 2019 folk horror film written and directed by Ari Aster. The film stars Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor as a dysfunctional American couple who travel to rural Sweden with a group of friends for a midsummer festival, but find themselves in the clutches of a sinister cult claiming to practice Scandinavian paganism. Supporting actors include William Jackson Harper, Vilhelm Blomgren, Ellora Torchia, Archie Madekwe, and Will Poulter.
A co-production between the United States and Sweden, the film was initially pitched to Aster as a straightforward slasher film set among Swedish cultists. While elements of the original concept remain in the final product, the finished film focuses on a deteriorating relationship inspired by a difficult breakup experienced by Aster himself. The film's soundtrack, composed by British electronic musician Bobby Krlic (better known as The Haxan Cloak), takes inspiration from Nordic folk music. The film was shot on location in Budapest from July to October 2018.
Midsommar was theatrically released in the United States by A24 on July 3, 2019, and in Sweden by Nordisk Film on July 10, 2019. The film grossed $48 million and received positive reviews, with praise for Aster's direction and Pugh's performance in particular, although it polarized general audiences.


Plot[edit]
American student Dani is left deeply traumatized after her bipolar sister Terri kills their parents and herself. The incident further strains Dani's relationship with her increasingly distant boyfriend, a fellow student named Christian, who, with his friends Mark and Josh, has been invited by their Swedish friend Pelle to attend a midsummer festival at his ancestral commune, the Hårga, in the rural Hälsingland region of Sweden. The festival occurs only once every 90 years; Josh, who is writing his thesis on European midsummer festivities, regards it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Christian had not discussed the trip with Dani, as he intended to break up with her before her family tragedy happened, but he reluctantly invites her along after an argument.
Upon arrival at the commune, they meet Simon and Connie, a British couple who were invited by Pelle's commune-brother Ingemar, who offers the group psychedelic mushrooms, causing Dani to have a bad trip and hallucinate about her dead family. The day after their arrival, the group witnesses an ättestupa ceremony, where two elders commit suicide by jumping off a cliff onto the rocks below. When one of the elders survives the fall, the commune members mimic his wails of pain before crushing his head with a mallet. Commune elder Siv attempts to calm Connie and Simon by explaining that every member of their community does this at the age of 72, and that it is believed to be a great honor.
Christian also decides to write his thesis on the Hårga commune, irritating Josh by plagiarizing his idea. Disturbed by the ceremonies, Dani attempts to leave, but Pelle convinces her to stay. He explains that he too was orphaned after his parents perished in a fire, and the commune became his new family. Connie and Simon demand to leave and are supposedly driven to a nearby train station individually. During his thesis research, Christian is told that outsiders are sometimes brought into the commune for ""mating"" purposes to avoid incest. He is encouraged to participate, but refuses. After unwittingly urinating on a sacred tree, Mark is lured away from the group by one of the female commune members and murdered in the woods. That night, Josh sneaks out of bed to take illicit photographs of the commune's sacred texts. He is caught and distracted by a man wearing Mark's skinned face, and is then bludgeoned to death with a mallet and dragged away.
The following day, both Dani and Christian are separately pressured into drinking a hallucinogenic tea. Dani wins a maypole dancing competition and is crowned May Queen. Christian is drugged and participates in a sex ritual designed to impregnate Maja, a young member of the Hårga, while older nude female members watch and mimic Maja's moans. Dani witnesses the ritual and has a panic attack while the commune's women surround her, mimicking her cries of sorrow. After the ritual, a naked Christian attempts to flee. He discovers Josh's severed leg planted in a flowerbed and Simon, barely alive on display in a barn, the latter having been made into a blood eagle. An elder then paralyzes Christian with a drug.
For the final ceremony, the commune leaders explain that the commune must offer nine human sacrifices to purge it of evil. The first four victims (Mark, Josh, Simon, and Connie) were outsiders lured to them by Pelle and Ingemar, while the next four victims (the two ättestupa elders, plus volunteers Ingemar and Ulf) are from the commune. As the May Queen, Dani must choose either Christian or a randomly chosen commune member as the final sacrifice. She chooses Christian, who is stuffed into a disemboweled brown bear's body and placed in a triangular wooden temple alongside the other sacrifices. The commune members to be sacrificed are given drugs and told they will feel no fear or pain, but Christian is not and remains paralyzed. The structure is set alight, and the commune members mimic the screams of those being burned alive. Dani initially sobs in horror and grief, but the closing shot is her smiling widely.

Production[edit]
Development[edit]
Writer and director Ari Aster
In May 2018, it was announced that Ari Aster would write and direct the film, with Lars Knudsen serving as producer. B-Reel Films, a Swedish company, produced the film alongside Square Peg, with A24 distributing.[4] Aster's previous horror film, Hereditary, had been a huge critical success, making over $80 million to become A24's highest-grossing film worldwide.[5] According to Aster, he had been approached by B-Reel executives Martin Karlqvist and Patrik Andersson[6] to helm a slasher film set in Sweden, an idea which he initially rejected as he felt he ""had no way into the story."" Aster ultimately devised a plot in which the two central characters are experiencing relationship tensions verging on a breakup, and wrote the surrounding screenplay around this theme. He described the result as ""a breakup movie dressed in the clothes of a folk horror film.""[7] Aster has mentioned 1981 Albert Brooks film Modern Romance as an inspiration for Midsommar, and also called it ""The Wizard of Oz for perverts"".[8]
Aster worked with the film's production designer Henrik Svensson to develop the film's folklore elements and the traditions of the Hårga, while visiting Hälsingland together.[9][10] He researched Hälsingegårds, ""centuries-old farms that typically had painting on the walls"", to develop a stylized version for the set, as well as May Day and midsummer celebrations in Swedish, German and English folklore. Aster also researched spiritual movements and communities, saying he particularly drew inspiration from Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy and the theosophy movement.[10]
Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, Will Poulter, Vilhem Blomgren, William Jackson Harper, Ellora Torchia, and Archie Madekwe joined the cast in July 2018.[11][12]

Filming[edit]
Some early scenes set in the United States were also filmed there; Dani's apartment was filmed in Brooklyn, New York City, while other scenes where Christian's friends interact were filmed in Utah. The majority of the film was shot in Hungary rather than Sweden, primarily due to financial constraints, but also as Sweden limits daily film shoots to no longer than eight hours.[9] Principal photography began on July 30, 2018, in Budapest, and wrapped that October.[13]
Harper said the shoot was ""arduous"" due to the heat.[14] Wasps were highly abundant and a major issue on set.[14][15] Pugh reflected ""the shoot was totally nuts"" and commended Aster's direction: ""he was dealing with possibly 100, 120 people, additional extras and actors there, all speaking in three different languages and he was the captain of the ship"".[16]
Ahead of filming the drug use scenes, Reynor said that the cast discussed their own experiences with psychedelic mushrooms.[6] On her breakdown scene with the Hårga, Pugh commended the other women involved, saying they ""made this scene possible"" as she typically struggles to cry on camera. She reflected: ""I knew I would never be so open and so raw and so exhausted like I was that day ever again"".[17]
The sex scene between Christian and Maja was filmed on the final day.[15] Reynor said he spent time attempting to boost morale among the other cast members involved, none of whom spoke English, including Isabelle Grill (who plays Maja) who was appearing in her first feature film role. He reflected he felt male nudity was unusual for a horror film, where female nudity is more typical. He said that he ""advocated for as much full-frontal nudity as possible, I really wanted to embrace the feeling of being exposed and the humiliation of this character. And I felt really, really vulnerable, more than I had actually even anticipated.”[6]

Props and costume design[edit]
Svensson said the mallet prop used for the senicide scene was a replica of one at a museum in Stockholm, and that the cliff-jumping was based on historic practices in Sweden.[6] Costume designer Andrea Flesch developed the Hårga's costumes with antique linen from Hungary and Romania, and buttons from Sweden.[6] Aster asked for the clothing to appear handmade, and for the Hårga to dress in white. Many of their costumes were hand-embroidered with rune designs unique to individual community members, signifying their families and occupations.[6] Murals and tapestries in the background of some scenes indicate events in the film.[6]
In April 2020, A24 announced it would be auctioning off props from its films and television series, including the 10,000-silk-flower May Queen dress worn by Pugh, which was reportedly purchased by the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures for $65,000, after both Ariana Grande and Halsey had expressed interest on social media.[18] The proceeds were donated to provide COVID-19 pandemic relief for firefighters and their families.[18] Other items from the film that sold at auction were the bear costume worn by Reynor for $4,760, the mallet used to crush a cult member's skull for $10,000, and other villager costumes that sold in the $4,500 range. All the proceeds from the Midsommar collection raised over $100,000 for the FDNY Foundation.[19]

Post-production[edit]
Aster said the visual effects for the psychedelic scenes involved considerable trial and error: ""I'm sure for some of those shots we got to the point where we had 60 versions. In one iteration the tripping was way too distracting and you're not paying attention to the characters, and then you brought it down to the point where if you are paying attention to the characters, you'll never notice the tripping effects."" The more minimal visual effects were settled on a week before the first screening.[6]
There was around a six-week debate as to whether the film would be given an NC-17 rating or R rating by the MPAA for its US release due to its graphic nudity, with it eventually being given an R rating after cuts. An NC-17 rating is considered harmful to a film's box-office performance.[20]

Music[edit]
Main article: Midsommar (soundtrack)
Aster recruited electronic musician Bobby Krlic (The Haxan Cloak) to compose the film's score, having written the film while listening to Krlic's 2013 album Excavation.
Aster wrote the film while listening to British electronic musician The Haxan Cloak's 2013 album Excavation. Aster later recruited him to compose the film's score, credited under his real name Bobby Krlic. Krlic began composing the music before filming began, taking inspiration from Nordic folk music, and collaborating closely with Aster. The film makes use of diegetic music, where events on screen meld with the score.[21][22][23]
The soundtrack album was released on July 5, 2019 via Milan Records.[24]

Release[edit]
Midsommar had a pre-release screening at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in New York City, on June 18, 2019.[25] The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 3, 2019.[26]

Director's cut[edit]
Aster's original 171-minute cut of the film, which A24 asked Aster to trim down for a wide theatrical release, had its world premiere at the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City on August 20, 2019.[27] It was shown in theaters across the United States for a weekend starting on August 29, 2019. The director's cut was released as an Apple TV exclusive on September 24, 2019.[28] On physical media, it saw a British release on Blu-ray and DVD on October 28, 2019,[29] an Australian Blu-ray release on November 6, 2019[30] and a US release on Blu-ray in July 2020.[31]

Home media[edit]
Midsommar was released on Digital HD on September 24, 2019, and on DVD and Blu-ray on October 8, 2019.[32] The director's cut of the film was then released on Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray as an A24 shop exclusive on July 20, 2020, in limited copies.[33]

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]
Midsommar grossed $27.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $20.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $48 million.[3]
In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,707 theaters over its first five days.[34] It made $3 million on its first day, including $1.1 million from Tuesday night previews, which Deadline Hollywood called a ""smashing start"".[35][36] It went on to debut to $10.9 million, finishing sixth at the box office; IndieWire said it was ""just decent"" given its estimated $8 million budget, but the film would likely find success in home media.[37][38] In its second weekend, the film dropped 44% to $3.7 million, finishing in eighth,[39] and then made $1.6 million in its third weekend, finishing in ninth.[40]

Audience reception[edit]
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of ""C+"" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 3 out of 5 stars, with 50% saying they would definitely recommend it.[35] Ankur Pathak of The Huffington Post says it ""divided audiences (and some critics)"",[41] while Screen Rant writer Mark Birrell said it was ""one of the most polarizing horror movies of 2019"" among general audiences. Birrell cited, as the film's positive qualities, its performances, cinematography, music, its atmospheric tone, which Birel said was grounded in realism and a high level of attention to detail, and its themes, which included its exploration of mental health issues. However, he attributed its uneven audience reception to negative aspects, such its length, its lack of subtlety, its derivativeness and poor use of genre clichés, its over-stylization, its tendency to be over-serious, the implausible plot, the one-dimensionality of the characters, which Birell found irritating, and the fact that he did not find the film scary.[42]

Critical response[edit]
Florence Pugh garnered critical acclaim for her performance as Dani Ardor.
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 404 reviews, and an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Ambitious, impressively crafted, and above all unsettling, Midsommar further proves writer-director Ari Aster is a horror auteur to be reckoned with.""[43] On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film has a score of 72 out of 100, based on 54 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[44]
John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as the ""horror equivalent of a destination wedding"", and ""more unsettling than frightening, [but] still a trip worth taking.""[45] Writing for Variety, Andrew Barker noted that it is ""neither the masterpiece nor the disaster that the film's most vocal viewers are bound to claim. Rather, it's an admirably strange, thematically muddled curiosity from a talented filmmaker who allows his ambitions to outpace his execution.""[46] David Edelstein of Vulture praised Pugh's performance as ""amazingly vivid"" and noted that Aster ""paces Midsommar more like an opera (Wagner, not Puccini) than a scare picture,"" but concluded that the film ""doesn't jell because its impulses are so bifurcated. It's a parable of a woman's religious awakening—that's also a woman's fantasy of revenge against a man who didn't meet her emotional needs—that's also a male director's masochistic fantasy of emasculation at the hands of a matriarchal cult.""[7] In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis was critical of the character depth behind Dani and Christian, finding them ""instructively uninteresting"" and stereotypically gendered as a couple.[47]
Eric Kohn of IndieWire summarized the film as a ""perverse breakup movie,"" adding that ""Aster doesn't always sink the biggest surprises, but he excels at twisting the knife. After a deflowering that makes Ken Russell's The Devils look tame, Aster finds his way to a startling reality check.""[48] Time Out's Joshua Rothkopf awarded the film a 5/5 star-rating, writing, ""A savage yet evolved slice of Swedish folk-horror, Ari Aster's hallucinatory follow-up to Hereditary proves him a horror director with no peer.""[49]
For The A.V. Club, A. A. Dowd stated that the film ""rivals Hereditary in the cruel shock department"", and labelled it a ""B+ effort"".[50] Writing for Inverse, Eric Francisco commented that the film feels ""like a victory lap after Hereditary"", and that Aster ""takes his sweet time to lull viewers into his clutches ... But like how the characters experience time, its passage is a vague notion."" He described the film as ""a sharp portrayal of gaslighting"".[51] Richard Brody of The New Yorker said that the film ""is built on such a void of insight and experience, such a void of character and relationships, that even the first level of the house of narrative cards can't stand."" He added, ""In the end, the subject of Midsommar is as simple as it is regressive: lucky Americans, stay home.""[52] Emma Madden in The Guardian criticised the film for its depiction of disabled characters as ""monstrous"", and argued it resurrects harmful horror film tropes of ableism and eugenics.[53]
Tomris Laffly of RogerEbert.com rated the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as a ""terrifically juicy, apocalyptic cinematic sacrament that dances around a fruitless relationship in dizzying circles"".[54] A Vanity Fair article from December 2019 reflecting on the 2010s in horror films argued that Midsommar was part of a trend of ""elevated horror"" along with Aster's previous Hereditary and Robert Eggers directed The Witch, and that it was an example of ""horror at its best"".[55]

Themes and analysis[edit]
Swedish illustrator John Bauer's Stackars lilla Basse! appears in an early scene in the film; Vox proposes it hints at later moments in the film, while also aligning with the film's fairy tale style.[63]
Writing in The Guardian, Steve Rose describes Midsommar as ""a powerful study of grief, betrayal, breakups, and more"". Rose suggests that Dani's three male companions may be seen as representing ""toxic masculinity"", or analogues of the three male companions in The Wizard of Oz (namely the Tin Man, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow). Rose proposes that the film may be read as a ""parable of snarky, city-smart, modern rationalism undone by primal rural values"". Alternatively, he proposes that the villagers' traditions could be read as far-right, white nationalist or eugenicist.[8]
In Vox, Alissa Wilkinson described Midsommar's story as following Dani's emotional journey and following fairy tale conventions, where Dani loses her family at the beginning and goes on to become a Queen, as with Cinderella and Snow White. The article also notes the use of imagery foreshadowing later events throughout the film.[63] Aster himself said ""We begin as Dani loses a family, and we end as Dani gains one. And so, for better or worse, [the Hårga] are there to provide exactly what she is lacking, and exactly what she needs, in true fairy tale fashion.""[10]
Monica Wolfe discussed Midsommar as reflecting themes of globalization and American imperialism in a 2022 article in the Journal of Popular Film and Television. Wolfe outlines the film's competing ideologies of femininity versus masculinity, academic knowledge versus folk knowledge, and capitalism versus communism, writing that ""the horror of the film is driven by the objectified Other’s resistance to the imperial power’s desire to dominate physical place and own ideological space, but is complicated by a suggestion that, in this unique case, the Other is also a nationalist, right-wing power, and the tension between home and foreign reflects that of a new Cold War.""[64]
The film's central sex scene, between Christian and Maja, has been the subject of debate as to whether it depicts rape. An article in Sexuality & Culture asserts that ""the ambiguous nature of this scene may be viewed as problematic because it blurs the line between consent and sexual assault"" and that the film has implications for contemporary understandings of rape, particularly of males.[65]
Yusuke Narita, a Japanese professor at Yale University, positively cited a scene in the film where an elderly person is forced to jump off a cliff. Narita used this as an example of ""mass suicide"" or ""mass seppuku"", which he claimed was the only way to solve the aging crisis in Japan. The comments resulted in a major controversy but also resulted in Narita becoming a popular figure among some young Japanese people.[66]

Between cuts, the bottle appears capped before he is seen recapping it. In the subsequent shots, he moves the same bottle from one place to another, and it appears first uncapped, then capped.QuotesDixon Steele: I was born when she kissed me. I died when she left me. I lived a few weeks while she loved me.ConnectionsEdited into Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982)SoundtracksI Hadn't Anyone Till You(uncredited)Written by Ray NoblePerformed by Hadda BrooksUser reviews240ReviewReviewFeatured review8/10 ""It was his story against mine, but of course, I told my story better.""In 1950, Billy Wilder released his latest masterpiece, 'Sunset Blvd.,' a scathing satire on the pitfalls of Hollywood celebrity, delicately drawing a contrast between the deluded and volatile has-been Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and the scheming wanna-be screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden). While Wilder's film deservedly received an overwhelming critical response, and its share of controversy, another impressive, similarly-themed film slipped beneath the radar that same year. For decades, director Nicholas Ray was overlooked and neglected by most film critics, before developing something of a cult following in the 1970s, and films such as 'Rebel Without a Cause (1955)'  which I first watched just a week ago  are now recognised as masterpieces. 'In a Lonely Place (1950)' has only now been lauded as one of the finest entries into the film-noir movement, and Humphrey Bogart's performance has emerged as among the most intense and profound in his distinguished repertoire. A brooding study of aggression, trust and success, Ray's film meticulously deconstructs the Hollywood myth, revealing a frightening world where the man you love could very well be a murderer.Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a down-on-his-luck screenwriter, an unsuccessful artist who resents being pressured into writing hackneyed, unoriginal scripts, which are guaranteed money-makers for the studios but possess zero artistic integrity. The morning after he brings home a bar hat-check girl (Martha Stewart) to recite the plot of the novel he is to adapt, Steele is hauled into the police department to explain why the girl was found murdered, her strangled body dumped from a moving vehicle. Appearing almost indifferent to the crime, Steele declines all knowledge of the homicide, and his story is shakily corroborated by a neighbour, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), with whom he forms an intimate relationship. As Steele begins to pen his latest screenplay, he uncovers an outlet for his pent-up aggression, however, when Laurel betrays a lingering suspicion that her love might possibly have perpetrated the horrific murder, he threatens to lash out in a fit of violence, only further cementing her misgivings. By the film's end, the tragedy of the couple's relationship is revealed: whether or not Steele actually did commit the murder is almost irrelevant; what ultimately dooms their romance is that he conceivably could have.In an obvious critique of the Hollywood studio system, Steele bitterly condemns the career of a successful producer, accusing him of remaking the same movie twenty times and of being a ""popcorn salesman."" The producer, apparently comfortable with his prosperous but creatively-deficient profession, snidely reminds Steele that everyone in Hollywood is inherently a ""popcorn salesman,"" so why fight it? It's this notion of creativity  or, rather, the lack of creativity in film-making  that forms the heart of 'In a Lonely Place.' There's no doubt that Dixon Steele is a talented screenwriter, but his reluctance to allow his work to be influenced by popular opinion makes him feel trapped and alone, as though Hollywood is attempting to stamp out his genius. His frustration with the film-making business is allowed to accumulate steadily within, before being unleashed in adrenaline-charged explosions of aggression and violence. From here is born the dilemma of Laurel's relationship with him: it is Steele's creativity with which she most assuredly fell in love, but this gift is intrinsically linked with the hostility of which she is so frightened.helpful•141ackstasisFeb 17, 2008Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ16How long is In a Lonely Place?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJanuary 12, 1951 (Netherlands)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishAlso known asIn a Lonely PlaceFilming locationsCity Hall - 455 N.

Bosworth himself was honored by the whole situation, saying ""Who else can say they got run over by Burt Reynolds?"" Reynolds went through the hit in one take with no injuries, though he had to be helped off the field.

For instance, Caretaker's line ""Tell Ronnie you got knocked the fuck out"" has been changed to ""Well, tell Ronnie he should have warned you about that truck"". Also, when Caretaker is telling the prison ""women"" that ""it's football, not balls-ball"", it has been replaced with ""it's football, not *that* kind of ball"". And when Ms. Tucker tells Brucie that his ""breath smells like eight cans of shark shit"", this has been replaced with ""your breath smells so bad, I don't know whether to get you a toothbrush or some toilet paper"". Cuts have been made to the video sequences between Crewe and the Warden's assistant, and to the one with Brucie and Ms. Tucker. In the final football game, the repeated statement ""I think he just shit himself"" has been changed to ""I think he broke his freakin' neck"".ConnectionsEdited into The Longest Yard: Deleted Scenes (2005)SoundtracksHella Goodby Pharrell Williams, Chad Hugo, Gwen Stefani & Tony KanalPerformed by No DoubtCourtesy of Interscope RecordsUnder license from Universal Music EnterprisesUser reviews365ReviewReviewFeatured review7/10 Take it for a stand alone movie..Don't compare today's comedy version of ""The Longest Yard"" to the old with Burt Reynolds. Today's is good and effective for what it is, a comedy film with a bit of action interlaced. So many classic Hollywood films were so good, that any attempt at a remake is just going to fall flat on its face. The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler is more of today's take on the story if you asked me. It has humor, and is Sandler at his best with Chris Rock playing his role well too. Critics and classic moviegoers beware. Unless you are open-minded, you will never find the hidden treasures of the movie world. It's a football comedy, plain and simple.helpful•11143kennethcoker1982-1Jun 3, 2005Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ5Why was Paul Crewe abusive to his girlfriend in the beginning of the movie?

It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.helpful•317MrHeracliusFeb 21, 2020Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ2Is 'Brave' based on a book?Is there an extra scene during or after the end credits?DetailsEditRelease dateJuly 18, 2012 (Netherlands)Countries of originUnited StatesJapanOfficial sitesOfficial FacebookOfficial siteLanguageEnglishAlso known asThe Bear and the BowFilming locationsEmeryville, California, USAProduction companiesWalt Disney PicturesPixar Animation StudiosSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditBudget$185,000,000 (estimated)Gross US & Canada$237,283,207Opening weekend US & Canada$66,323,594Jun 24, 2012Gross worldwide$538,983,207See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 33 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosDatasatDolby Surround 7.1SDDSDolby DigitalD-Cinema 96kHz Dolby Surround 7.1D-Cinema 48kHz Dolby Surround 7.1Aspect ratio2.39 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the Japanese language plot outline for Brave (2012)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

BiographyAwardsTriviaFAQIMDbProAll topicsChristopher Nolan(I)WriterProducerDirectorIMDbProStarmeterTop 50060Play clip1:50All About Oppenheimer26 Videos99+ PhotosBest known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed writer-director Christopher Nolan was born on July 30, 1970, in London, England. Over the course of 15 years of filmmaking, Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made.At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father's Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Following (1998), on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.Nolan's second film was Memento (2000), which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan. Starring Guy Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological thriller, Insomnia (2002), starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins (2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller The Prestige (2006), starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight (2008) which went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Nolan was nominated for a Directors Guild of America (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations.In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the sci-fi thriller Inception (2010), which he directed and produced from his own original screenplay. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the year. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with D.G.A. and P.G.A. Award nominations, as well as a W.G.A. Award for his work on the film.One of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, The Dark Knight Rises (2012) concluded Nolan's Batman trilogy. Due to his success rebooting the Batman character, Warner Bros. enlisted Nolan to produce their revamped Superman movie Man of Steel (2013), which opened in the summer of 2013. In 2014, Nolan directed, wrote, and produced the science-fiction epic Interstellar (2014), starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. released the film on November 5, 2014, to positive reviews and strong box-office results, grossing over $670 million dollars worldwide.Nolan resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, producer Emma Thomas, and their children.

The layers of dissembling and self-dissembling pile up so thickly that not only does Na evidently touch on something integral about the nature of evil, but actually seems to be in the process of summoning it before your eyes.

Na's film belongs on a shortlist of horror titles that question everything, forcing the realization that most people know nothing for certain and yet still behave with conviction. What could be more frightening?

Na Hong-jin creates the ultimate supernatural whodunnit, chucking everything except the kitchen sink at us to throw us off the scent of the whoever, or whatever is to blame.

NME (New Musical Express)
Na Hong-jin takes elements of zombies, black magic, ghosts, and possession stories, synthesizes these staid tropes in unique ways, and creates a visceral, moving film that is simultaneously hideous and exquisite, heart-breaking and horrifying.

AUDIENCE REVIEWS FOR THE WAILING
Feb 12, 2017
My love of South Korean films really started as an extension of my love for Japanese movies. I discovered Takashi Miike's works around 2005 and I consumed as much of his work as I could. I own, at the very least, 7 of his movies on DVD. I honestly don't keep track. It could be more than that though, it's not more than 10, I'm fairly certain of that. The point is that my exposure to Miike at 17 years old opened me up to a whole new world of cinema that I had not discovered yet. 2005 was also the same year that I bought Oldboy, my favorite movie of all time, on DVD. And that started me off on the road to my attempt to watch every South Korean movie ever made. That's obviously hyperbolic, as there are so many films released there that don't even get any release over here that it's gonna be impossible for me to do so. But I've reviewed over 100+ South Korean films on here, and it's probably even more than that, 100 is just a conservative guess. There are films I've that aren't available to review here, so there's also that. As much as I love the culture and the films, there's things about some South Korean movies that I absolutely loathe. Like the usage of melodrama and hysterics. Loudly weeping. Shit like that. But it's also worth mentioning that some of my favorite movies of all time are South Korean. And this is why I say this, without any sort of sarcasm or anything like that, this is unlike any SK movie I've ever seen. It's also one of the few movies that left me, legitimately, stumped for words as to how I would actually start this review. Which is why I went on that little tangent on the origin of my fondness for this country and the films they produce. When I say that this movie stumped me or that it's unlike anything I've ever seen, I mean that in the most complimentary way possible. Because, you know, that I thought this was a completely phenomenal movie. One of the best South Korean movies I've seen in a while, that's how phenomenal it is. I don't know whether this movie can be described as a horror movie, but it definitely shares a lot of horror themes. But the fact of the matter is that it's not just a horror movie, it's so many things at once, yet it's not a movie that's too ambitious for its own good that it can't possibly live up to its own standards. Like I can see how some people thought Swiss Army Man's ambition and surreal elements ended up hurting the movie, but you don't get that sense here. The film does feature several genres at once, but it's all in service of the greater story. There's no tangents or irrelevant subplots at play here. Because of that, the film maintains tight focus on how its endgame is gonna play out. That's not saying that there aren't flaws, because there are. But I have to give credit where it's due and the film, as complex as it is in weaving its mysterious tale as to what is causing the people in this small mountain village to get an infection that turns them into zombie-like creatures that kill, or attempt to kill, everything in sight. Don't misunderstand me, this is NOT a zombie movie. Not in the slightest. In fact, the scenes that you get to see some of the villagers actually attempting to attack someone else add up to less than 10% of the entire movie. So for you zombie detractors out there, this is NOT a zombie movie and you don't have to worry about that. In all honesty, if the film relied just on that aspect and not of the mystery of who the Japanese man is and what exactly he's up to would have been negated. I like the fact that, realistically speaking, the murders in the village occur around the main narrative of figuring out who this Japanese man is and what his intentions may be. The murders themselves aren't even the main focus of the story. There's also this mysterious woman that our protagonist meets and figuring out how she plays into what is going is also a point of intrigue. Things become complicated for our lead character, when it is found out that his daughter is showing the symptoms of the same virus that's been ravaging the village. This is where he's really drawn into attempting to find out the mystery behind the man. I like how the film gets to this point, because the first part of it, involving the murders and the investigations behind them, the Japanese man and what he is or isn't, whether he's a ghost or a demon, are really played off as just rumors. In a small village, things like this are bound to happen, the cop thinks, so he sort of shrugs it off as baseless rumors. Naturally speaking, when his daughter starts showing the same symptoms. She's quick to anger and irrational, has a rash all over her body, our protagonist reacts like every other father would. Despite how irrational it may be, he must get to the bottom of this and make the Japanese man pay for what he's done to his daughter. He even brings in a shaman to perform an exorcism and cast a hex on the Japanese man to make sure that his daughter's infection is removed. It obviously doesn't work out that way, so he finds a mob and decides to go after the man and kill him. At least that's what I thought the plan was, maybe he just wanted the Japanese man to stop the 'curse', or whatever you want to call it, that he put on his daughter. I think the second part of the film is where the film will see its most detractors. Some will say that there's no reason that the movie should be as long as it is. And I can completely understand that, even if I disagree with it. Maybe it shouldn't have been as long as it was, but I think it used that time to build one of the most atmospheric movies I've seen in a while. There's an uneasy feeling underscoring pretty much every scene in the movie. There's a dread that you feel that things, inevitably, are gonna get much, much worse than they already are. And the film made great use of that atmosphere, which is part of why I loved this film so much. I don't think I've ever felt this much dread watching a movie in a long ass time. And that's rare for me. Obviously, it's not like I was watching through my fingers, I'm not that naive, but there's some legitimately chilling and creepy scenes here. The film is scary not because they call attention to anything in specific, but because of the exact opposite. They're so subtle about it and that's what gives the atmosphere its strength. The film is exceptionally written because it manages to keep you guessing right until the very end. There's so many unreliable characters here that it's impossible to know who's telling the truth and who's lying out their ass. Which is why you can sense the desperation in the climactic act from the main character. He does not know who to trust and, instinctively, he goes with his gut feeling. Whether following his gut feeling ended up helping or not is for you to figure out, since that would be spoiling too much. The acting is pretty much excellent all around and, technically speaking, this is top-notch work on pretty much every level. I believe that among the other complaints the film will have is the fact that there are no legitimate answers to everything that's going on. And, again, I get it even though I disagree with it. Bu the difference is that this is still a narrative with a beginning, a middle and an end. It's not a movie that refuses to give you an ending, it gives you one. Is the ending all that clear? No, but that's because the movie actually wants you to view it more than once. It wants you to use the knowledge you gained on your first viewings to pick up on smaller details that you may have not noticed the first time around. They treat their audience as intelligent beings. It's not a movie that's purposely confusing because they couldn't actually be bothered to come up with an ending. I really don't know what else to say about this that I haven't already. I fucking loved this movie. It's not gonna win everybody over, but it is gonna inspire some heated discussions. Or at least I hope it does. I'm looking forward to a second viewing.

SUPER REVIEWER
Nov 08, 2016
Undoubtedly, objectively, you can look back on 2016 and point out that it is one of the best years for horror films in the past several decades. I feel a bit robbed that I didn't get a chance to see ""The Wailing"" in theaters. Granted, it was a limited release for this South Korean gem, but I hadn't any idea it existed until a few weeks ago. Equal parts mystical horror and zombie gore, the film wastes none of it's two and a half hours on clunky exposition or pointless character building. The first thirty minutes focus on some inept cops bumbling their way through an X-File's episode of odd occurrences. By the end of the first act, the silliness completely abates, and the true horror starts. There are scenes where just the sets are horrifying enough in their implications. The real meat of the horror is during cacophonous dark magic rituals that bring to mind ""Baraka"" mixed with ""Baskin"". Unlike the aforementioned Turkish horror film from earlier this year, ""The Wailing"" never devolves into torture porn, and the mystery deepens as twist after twist shifts the ambiguous protagonists into higher stakes situations and more emotional wretchedness. Perhaps the creepiest thing about the film is the city meets country atmosphere that always seems to be on the verge of dusk with evil spirits lurking underneath each storm cloud. There are some scenes that could have been shortened or strange unrealistic choices from the characters on occasion, but all in all Hong Jin-na has made an excellently scary film that has put many of his American contemporaries to shame, even considering how high the bar was already set.

Bad Santa 2 is a 2016 Christmas black comedy drama film directed by Mark Waters and written by Shauna Cross and Johnny Rosenthal. A sequel to the 2003 film Bad Santa, the film stars Billy Bob Thornton, Tony Cox, Brett Kelly, Kathy Bates, and Christina Hendricks, and features criminals Willie and Marcus again teaming up to work as Santa and an elf, respectively, this time to rob a Chicago charity on Christmas Eve.
Principal photography began on January 11, 2016, in Montreal, and the film was released in the United States on November 23, 2016, by Broad Green Pictures. In contrast to the original film, it received generally negative reviews and grossed $24.1 million worldwide against its $26 million budget (less than a third of the original film's $76.5 million), making it a box-office bomb.


Plot[edit]
Set 13 years after the first film, Willie Soke remains depressed as ever, upset his ""happy ending"" did not pan out, as he is again addicted to sex and alcohol. As he tries and fails to kill himself, he is visited by Thurman ""The Kid"" Merman, who has just turned 21 and works at a sandwich shop called Hungry Hoagies. Unfortunately, Thurman's father has abandoned him and his grandmother has passed on two years before making Willie the closest thing to family he has left. Thurman delivers to Willie a package containing a large sum of cash, and Willie soon finds out it's from Marcus, his former partner who has been released from jail after the events 13 years earlier. Marcus, expressing sincere remorse for betraying Willie, tells Willie he has an opportunity in Chicago that can potentially net them millions, though he is unwilling to disclose the name of his contact. Willie reluctantly agrees, while unsuccessfully trying to help Thurman lose his virginity before he leaves for Chicago.
Upon their arrival, Willie is annoyed to learn that not only is target of the con a charity but that his estranged mother, Sunny, is Marcus' contact. Willie reluctantly agrees since Sunny, who uses ""shit stick"" as a term of endearment for Willie, is suffering from the early stages of Parkinson's Disease, though he secretly makes a deal with Marcus to cut Sunny out when the time comes. Forced to don the Santa suit once more, Willie is arrested when he beats up a much jollier Santa who Willie mistakenly thinks is a pedophile, but is bailed out by one of the charity's founders, Diane. Though she wants to fire Willie for his behavior, she relents when he agrees to attend AA meetings with her. Diane's husband, the Regent, who also runs the charity and is cheating on Diane with his secretary, orders his head security guard Dorfman to track and follow Willie, becoming suspicious of how much time he's spending with Diane.
Meanwhile, Marcus, after doing recon work, tries to seduce security guard Gina so he can obtain the keys to Regent's office where the charity's safe is kept, but he fails to do so, as Gina is ""high maintenance"". Elsewhere, Willie starts a sexual relationship with Diane, and he and Sunny start to bond, especially when the two of them rob a mansion together with Willie posing as Santa and Sunny as Mrs. Claus. As they bond over their haul afterward, Sunny gives Willie a gun so he can betray and take revenge on Marcus, despite Willie's insistence that Marcus has changed.
Thurman soon arrives in Chicago, having followed Willie to the city. Willie at first considers leaving him at a laundromat but soon takes him to the charity's shelter. Thurman ends up joining the children's choir, which is set to have a concert on the night of Willie, Sunny, and Marcus's heist. Willie soon encounters Gina, who, thanks to Sunny's prodding, believes Willie wants to sleep with her. They have sex in the bathroom of a bar, and Willie obtains the keys. On the night of the show/robbery, Willie catches Thurman singing, which makes the kid very happy. As Willie cracks the safe, Marcus is about to betray him again, but they escape just as Regent and Dorfman discover the con. However, Sunny reveals she is betraying them both, telling Willie the bullets in the gun she gave him are blanks before shooting Marcus. She tries to escape by disappearing into a crowd of people dressed as Santa at an outdoor party. Willie, Regent, and Dorfman chase her. Despite blending in, Willie catches her and attempts to take the bag of stolen cash by saying the kids need it more. In their struggle, the bag is torn open and the money goes flying into the crowd. Enraged, Sunny attempts to shoot him again, but hits Thurman in his behind instead. Both Sunny and Willie are arrested, but Willie is not charged due to his help in catching Sunny. While he recovers, he is visited in the hospital by Diane who wakes him up with a handjob.
Willie soon takes a job as a janitor at the charity, where he continues to visit Thurman and accepts him as family. He also visits an injured Marcus, but proceeds to ""tea bag"" him and post pictures of this on Instagram, as revenge against Marcus for doing the same thing to him.

Production[edit]
In 2009, Billy Bob Thornton first mentioned the sequel to the 2003 film Bad Santa, with an aim for release at Christmas 2011.[9] On December 16, 2010, it was announced that Miramax and The Weinstein Company (TWC) had signed on an agreement to develop sequels including one for Bad Santa.[10] On March 18, 2011, TheWrap reported that Weinstein confirmed the sequel and negotiations had begun with Thornton to return for the lead role.[11] On July 14, 2011, the Los Angeles Times confirmed that Dimension Films and other producers on the film, including Geyer Kosinski, had hired two writers Johnny Rosenthal and John Phillips to work on the screenplay.[12] The sequel was scheduled to begin shooting in fall 2012 for a December 2013 release.[13] On July 30, 2012, it was reported that Steve Pink was in early talks with the studio to rewrite and direct the film.[14] On May 30, 2013, it was revealed that Miramax has hired Entourage creator Doug Ellin to rewrite the script, and to possibly direct the sequel.[15]
In October 2014, Thornton confirmed that the sequel was in development, adding ""We're never gonna beat the first one but you got to get as close as you can.""[16] On October 29, 2015, it was confirmed that Thornton would return to play Willie in Bad Santa 2, and that filming would begin in Montreal in January 2016, for a scheduled release of Christmas 2016.[4] Miramax and Broad Green Pictures would co-finance the film, with Broad Green also distributing the film in the United States, and Sierra/Affinity handling the international sales for the film.[4] On November 3, 2015, it was announced that Mean Girls director Mark Waters would direct the film from a script by Rosenthal, Ellin, and Shauna Cross, while Brett Kelly and Tony Cox from the first film also signed on to return.[6]
On November 19, 2015, it was announced that Kathy Bates would join the cast as Willie's foul-mouthed mother, while Andrew Gunn would also produce the film, along with Kosinski.[5] Originally, Rosenthal had written the character as Willie's father, Earl, but Cross believed changing the character to Willie's mother would be funnier. Cross explained, ""I think that while there's something funny about an absentee father, the terrible father figure is played out. You're screwed if you have a bad dad, but you're extra screwed if you have a mother who is that terrible. It almost seemed to thematically show the origins and set the tone of what the original film was about.""[17] Rosenthal agreed with the change, adding, ""Seeing Earl turn into Sunny didn't change anything story-wise. You wouldn't notice much of a difference between the two – they were both chauvinistic, misogynistic, racist, abusive alcoholics. But I think it was a great choice just to add a little estrogen, no matter how testosterone-fueled it was. I think that switch only added to the humor of the finished product.""[17] Cross was convinced that only one actress was right for the part, saying, ""I think the minute we had the idea to make it the mom I only pictured Kathy Bates as that person. It had to be her. I think I kept calling her 'Kathy' while I was writing her even before we had her.""[17]
On January 6, 2016, Christina Hendricks joined the cast, playing the head of a charitable organization.[7] On January 11, 2016, more cast was added to the film, including Ryan Hansen, Jenny Zigrino, and Jeff Skowron[8] Principal photography on the film began on January 11, 2016, in Montreal.[18][19] Filming took place on locations including Saint Catherine Street and Saint-Alexandre.[20]

Release[edit]
In December 2015, it was announced that Bad Santa 2 would be released on November 23, 2016, by Broad Green Pictures in America, while Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions would handle worldwide distribution.[21] The first promotional trailer for the film was released on August 9, 2016.[22]

Box office[edit]
Bad Santa 2 grossed $17.8 million in the United States and Canada and $5.4 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $23.2 million, against a production budget of $26 million.[3]
Bad Santa 2 opened alongside Moana, Rules Don't Apply and Allied, and was expected to gross $15–20 million from 2,920 theaters over its first five days.[23] The film ended up grossing $9 million over its first five days ($6.1 million in its opening weekend), finishing below expectations and 7th at the box office. It was also down 46% from the five-day opening of the first film, which made $16.8 million in 2003.[24]

Critical response[edit]
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 23% based on 135 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Loaded up with the same scatological and misanthropic humor as its predecessor but precious little of its heart or genuine wit, Bad Santa 2 presents a foulmouthed shadow of Christmas past.""[25] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".[26] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""C+"" on an A+ to F scale (lower than the first film's ""B""), while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 69% overall positive score and a 51% ""definite recommend"".[24]
Alex Welch of IGN gave the film 5/10, and wrote that it ""does little to dispel the notion that most sequels simply aren't necessary.""[27] Kyle Smith for the New York Post described it as ""vulgar, nasty and offensive, but it has flawed aspects also"", and ""so raunchy, you may feel the urge to wash your ears out with soap, not that the language is the only dirty thing about it.""[28] Ben Kenigsberg for The New York Times also found the film wanting, although praised Kathy Bates' performance.[29] Vince Mancini for Uproxx said that the sequel will make [one] appreciate the original, and criticised the film's humor as ""plug-to-play one liners"", while also noting that the film ""isn't terrible"".[30]
Amy Nicholson for MTV mockingly referred to the film as Badly Traumatized Santa, and wrote that ""[it] doesn't hate Christmas.""[31]

Very faithful on the most part to their respective source materials, and any changes that are made every now and again are not usually hindrances, and very accessible for the whole family, and it is a shame that they are not more widely known. As they really do deserve a wide audience.'Santabear's High Flying Adventure' is not as good as 'Santabear's First Christmas' and is not as high flying as that. There is more of a plot here and it is very oddly charming, but the quaint tone and simplicity that 'Santabear's First Christmas' had so beautifully is not as strong here. Enough of the things that made 'Santabear's First Christmas' so good can be seen here too in 'Santabear's High Flying Adventure' but was done with more impact beforeThe visuals are generally lovely to look at, especially the simple but elegant backgrounds and Santabear's character design. The music matches beautifully with pleasant orchestration and doesn't try to do too much, absolutely loved the lullaby. Though the score in the previous Santabear adventure had a more mysterious and elegiac quality that worked better.Furthermore, the story is fun and charming, very easy to like and it is cute on the whole. Kelly McGillis' voice work is soothing and sincere and Bobby McFerrin has fun as both Santabear and Bullybear, especially as the latter where his personality shines more.John Malkovich is less successful however as Santa. Found him rather dull and wooden. While liking the story on the whole, it does veer on the bizarre at times and more quaintness and a quieter tone wouldn't have gone amiss.Did also find the dialogue at points rather stilted and quite strange.Overall, nice enough but had room for improvement. 7/10helpful•51TheLittleSongbirdSep 11, 2020Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateDecember 24, 1987 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishProduction companiesDayton-Hudson CorporationMichael Sporn AnimationRabbit Ears ProductionsSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime23 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Santabear's High Flying Adventure (1987) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit page

When he returned to work, he was fascinated to find that nobody would mention or acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such commonplace things as ""How was your weekend?"" Palahniuk concluded that the reason people reacted this way was because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to connect with him on a personal level. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which became the foundation for the novel.Goofs(at around 1h 15 mins) When The Mechanic (Holt McCallany) sprays the Seminary Student (Matt Winston) with a hose, the camera briefly shakes because the cameraman was laughing uncontrollably.QuotesTyler Durden: [31:14] The things you own end up owning you.Crazy creditsThe warning at the beginning of the DVD, after the copyright warnings
reads:
WARNING
If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every word you
read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don't
you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly
can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so
impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all who
claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think
everything you're supposed to think? Buy what you're told you should
want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex.
Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a
fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will
become a statistic. You have been warned...... TylerAlternate versionsThe version available for streaming in China has around a minute of footage of material from sex scenes were removed. Also, for a period the closing scene of the buildings being destroyed was replaced with an English-language text card reading, ""The police rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding. After the trial, Tyler was sent to lunatic asylum [sic] receiving psychological treatment. He was discharged from the hospital in 2012.""

Ingredients



3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, divided


1 large red bell pepper, diced


1 small zucchini, diced


1  jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced


1 cup broccoli florets (1/2-inch)


¼ cup water plus 2 2/3 cups, divided


8 slices whole-wheat bread


4 slices Cheddar cheese


2 (11 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup






Directions




Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until melted and foamy. Add bell pepper, zucchini and jalapeño; cook, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add broccoli and stir to coat. Add ¼ cup water, cover the pan and cook until the broccoli is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, draining off water if necessary. Wipe the pan clean.





Spread the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over 1 side of each bread slice. Place the bread slices, buttered-side down, in the pan. Divide the vegetables among the bread slices. Top each with a slice of cheese and a bread slice, buttered-side up. Cook over medium heat until the sandwiches are lightly browned and the cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes per side. (Cook the sandwiches in batches if they don't all fit in your skillet.)





Meanwhile, combine soup and the remaining 1 ⅔ cups water in a medium saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Cut the sandwiches in half and serve with the soup.

Nutrition information is calculated by a registered dietitian using an ingredient database but should be considered an estimate.

* Daily Values (DVs) are the recommended amounts of nutrients to consume each day. Percent Daily Value (%DV) found on nutrition labels tells you how much a serving of a particular food or recipe contributes to each of those total recommended amounts. Per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the daily value is based on a standard 2,000 calorie diet. Depending on your calorie needs or if you have a health condition, you may need more or less of particular nutrients. (For example, it’s recommended that people following a heart-healthy diet eat less sodium on a daily basis compared to those following a standard diet.)

You don't need much to make yourself a stack of crispy-on-the-outside, soft-in-the-middle French toast! Just eggs, milk, bread — and don't forget the maple syrup to pour over top!


   How to Make French Toast  

French toast is very easy: whisk together eggs and milk, add thick slices of bread for a quick soak, then fry them up in a hot buttered pan.



This recipe uses just a few basic ingredients you likely have in the kitchen already. Bonus: French toast freezes incredibly well, so make a big batch of easy breakfasts during the week.


   The Best Bread for French Toast  

Any soft, thick bread will work for making French toast. Go for challah or brioche if you're feeling decadent, or keep it simple with white sandwich bread or Texas toast. Rustic country loaves or crusty sourdough loaves can also be used, but will tend to be chewier.



Regardless of which bread you choose, cut it into thick slices if possible. This will give you the best ratio of crispy outsides to creamy middles. If your bread is pre-sliced, use what you have — the french toast will still be great.



Classically, French toast is made with stale bread that's been sitting on the counter for a few days. If you only have fresh bread, lay slices on a baking sheet and place it in the oven at 275 F for about 10 minutes, or until the center is dry.



Fresh bread can also be used, but won't soak up the milk-egg mixture quite as well and can sometimes fall apart during cooking.




Why Stale Bread is Best for French Toast

Using dry, stale bread is key to avoiding soggy French toast. Fresh bread already has a good deal of moisture, but the drier a bread is, the more room it has to soak up the egg custard — like a sponge.

   Ways to Top Your French Toast  

Keep It Classic: A sprinkle of cinnamon, a dash of powdered sugar, and a drizzle of maple syrup
Go Nuts: Sprinkle with toasted and chopped pecans, walnuts, or almonds.
Fruit-tastic: Blueberries, raspberries, sliced strawberries, or any other fresh, seasonal fruit can go on top of French toast. If you're feeling fancy, whip up a quick fruit compote.
Swap the Maple: Instead of maple syrup, try honey, date syrup, boiled cider, or fruit syrup.


   French Toast for a Crowd?  

If you'd like to serve your French toast all at once instead of in batches as they come off the stove, warm your oven to 200 F (or the ""Warm"" setting) and set a sheet pan on a middle rack. Transfer the French toast to the sheet pan as they're cooked to keep warm until you're ready to serve.





""This French toast recipe is perfect for a Sunday brunch. You can utilize any bread you have left over from the week to make this breakfast treat. Feel free to customize the recipe with different toppings, or keep it simple with the items you may already have in your fridge."" —Tracy Wilk











A Note From Our Recipe Tester



Ingredients




4 large eggs


1 cup milk (whole or 2%)


1 dash salt


1 teaspoon sugar, optional


2 tablespoons butter, for the pan


8 to 10 slices bread, preferably stale or day-old bread















Steps to Make It





Gather the ingredients.











The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck






Break the eggs into a wide, shallow bowl or pie plate and beat them lightly with a fork or whisk.











The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck






Stir the milk, sugar, and salt into the beaten eggs.











The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck






Coat a skillet or griddle with a thin layer of butter. Place it over medium-low heat.











The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck






Place the bread slices, one at a time, into the bowl or plate. Let the bread soak up the egg mixture for a few seconds and then carefully turn to coat the other side. Coat only as many slices as you will be cooking at one time to prevent soggy French toast. 











The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck






Transfer the egg-coated bread slices to the hot skillet or griddle. Heat slowly until the bottom is golden brown. Turn and brown the other side. Exact cooking time will depend on the thickness of your bread, but it shouldn't take more than a few minutes per side.











The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck






Serve French toast hot with butter and syrup, or your preferred toppings. Enjoy.











The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck







Tips

Use thick slices of bread and soak it just long enough to absorb the egg mixture but not so long that it becomes saturated.Shortening or oil can be used instead of butter when cooking the French toast. The amount needed will depend on the size of pan; use just enough to coat the bottom.



Recipe Variations


Add an extra teaspoon or two of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the egg mixture for cinnamon-spiced French toast.
Use part light cream, half-and-half, or heavy cream to create a silkier, richer egg batter.
Up your French toast game and make pain perdu. Meaning ""lost bread,"" this French-influenced New Orleans recipe uses allspice, cinnamon, and vanilla, with thick French baguette slices.




Why Does French Toast Taste Too Eggy?

To create the classic custard taste that makes French toast great, the ratio of eggs to milk is important. If the balance is off and you include too many eggs or not enough milk, the finished French toast will have a scrambled egg-like flavor. When scaling this recipe up or down, keep in mind that you need 1/4 cup of milk for every egg.



How to Freeze French Toast

Did you know you can freeze French toast? Make big batches and freeze French toast for easy breakfasts: Arrange the cooked and cooled French toast on a baking sheet, freeze for 1 hour, then transfer to freezer bags and seal. It will keep for up to two months. Reheat the French toast in the toaster or skillet.

Mediterranean Salmon 



Jump to Recipe·Print Recipe


This 15-minute Mediterranean salmon recipe features flaky, tender, lemony salmon topped with a juicy summer produce forward topper. Prepare it on the stove or baked in the oven for a healthy, delicious and gorgeous meal elegant enough to serve at any dinner party.
A big thank you to California Ripe Olives for helping create this recipe and sponsoring this post, all opinions posted are my own.

Why you’ll love this Mediterranean salmon recipe
The star at any easy al fresco gathering! You ask, and I shall deliver! I put out a poll on Instagram stories a few weeks ago to see what you guys were looking for as far as some entertaining recipes go and SO many of you said easy recipes for a dinner party! Well, a baked salmon lemon recipe instantly sparked my creativity! I even give you directions on how to make it pan-roasted or bake it in the oven. But if the warm weather is calling your name, you could even grill the salmon if that’s your preference!
Truly an ‘eat with your eyes’ dish! While this salmon is many things (quick, simple, easy), it’s also DELICIOUS. Tender flaky salmon with a light, herbaceous taste in every bite. The real star of the show though… the topper. Made with juicy produce like bursting summer tomatoes, salty green olives, tangy feta cheese and savory herbs.
Prep the topper ahead of time! Prep your salmon and the delicious fresh produce forward topper in just 10 minutes! When I’m hosting a dinner party I need recipes that are easy and look restaurant beautiful, and this salmon does just that! You can prep the colorful Mediterranean topper for the salmon the morning of serving to save yourself a little time. After the salmon is cooked, simply assemble on a serving platter and you’re good to go!








Ingredients for Mediterranean salmon 
For the salmon

(4) 5-6 ounce salmon fillets 
Fresh oregano
Garlic 
Olive oil
Lemon juice
Salt + pepper 

For the Mediterranean topper: 

Cherry tomatoes 
Green California ripe olives 
Cucumber
Parsley 
Basil
Feta cheese 
Olive oil
Salt + pepper

Scroll below for the recipe card and measurements.

How to make garlic lemon salmon
This is one of those fancy salmon recipes that looks like you spent all day slaving away in the kitchen. Here’s how it goes:


Season Salmon: In a medium bowl, add salmon fillets. Sprinkle evenly with oregano, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice. Mix together so salmon fillets are coated. Sprinkle fillets evenly on each side with kosher salt and cracked black pepper. 
Pan Fry: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add in a drizzle of olive oil so the bottom of the pan is well coated. When the pan is hot, add salmon, skin side down and cook for 5 minutes. With a fish spatula, gently flip the salmon fillets and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on the other side.
Prepare the Mediterranean topper: While salmon is cooking, add cherry tomatoes, green California ripe olives, cucumber, parsley, basil, feta cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and season to taste with kosher salt and cracked black pepper. Mix together and set aside to top salmon with. 
Finish and serve: Transfer salmon to a serving platter and top evenly with Mediterranean topper.



Alternative Method: Baked Lemon Salmon Recipe
To bake the salmon, season as directed and preheat the oven to 425 F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and arrange fillets evenly. Bake salmon for 12-14 minutes, or until it flakes off easily with a fork.
You can pan-fry the salmon with a large cast-iron skillet or bake it in the oven, whichever is better for you! 
Is this a healthy salmon recipe?
Yes! Here’s why:

Heart-healthy! Salmon is SO healthy, it’s filled with rich omega-3 fatty acids which are wonderful for good heart health. I am always looking for Mediterranean diet recipes with salmon and this one sure hits the spot.
Olive you! I love adding ripe California olives to dishes. They are packed with antioxidants, low in calories, and are a source of monounsaturated fat, which is associated with increased longevity, decreased risk of heart disease, reduced risk of chronic disease, lower blood pressure, and improved brain function! What a powerhouse food. 
It’s low carb! If you’re looking to watch your carbs, skip the couscous and serve it up as a salad on a bed of greens. 
Following Whole30? Skip the feta cheese and you’ve got a delicious whole30 friendly meal. Add in your favorite nut for some extra flavor instead!


Serving suggestions
I know the question on everyone’s mind is what to make with this Mediterranean salmon recipe. Well, I have got you covered with plenty of sides.
I served this salmon on a bed of pearled couscous and arugula. Or, swap out the couscous for another grain like brown rice, farro, lentils, or pasta. For those after some heartier sides with a bit more bulk and starch, definitely go with orzo lemon salad, vegan pasta salad, or mashed red potatoes.
If you’re looking for a light meal, pair it with broccolini salad, zucchini corn fritters or honey sriracha Brussel sprouts.
Meal prep tip: Mediterranean salmon salad!
I love meal prepping this Mediterranean salmon to have for a couple of days as a lunch option. I like to serve a fillet over a big bed of greens drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette and top it off with plenty of the homemade Mediterranean topper.

Storage, freezing and reheating
Storage: Leftover baked Mediterranean salmon and its topping is best stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Store the salmon and topping in two separate containers.
Freezing: I do not recommend freezing the salmon or cucumber tomato topping. For best results, make it fresh and enjoy it within 3 days.
Reheating: Reheat the leftover salmon in a 275 degree F oven, tented with foil, for about 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through. Salmon is best reheated low and slow to prevent the tender flesh from drying out.
Mediterranean salmon FAQ
Is salmon good for the Mediterranean diet?
Yes! Fish are an integral part of the Mediterranean diet, including salmon, mackerel, sardines, anchovies and tuna. All are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which is a type of fat known to reduce inflammation in the body. This baked salmon recipe is a wonderful way to introduce seafood into your weekly meal plan!
What’s the best salmon to cook?
If possible, go for wild-caught salmon as opposed to farm raised. Wild-caught has bright, vibrant pink skin and a slightly sweet briny flavor similar to the ocean. Plus, it’s packed with tons more protein, omega-3’s and antioxidants.
What herbs go best with salmon?
Honestly, any herb compliments salmon beautifully, but I really enjoy the floral, nuanced taste of fresh oregano. Keep in mind, fresh oregano is a lot stronger in flavor compared to its dried counterpart, so a little goes a long way. Feel free to also try marjoram, thyme or rosemary.
Is it better to pan fry or bake salmon?
This is all about personal preference. I find pan-frying to be more interactive as you have to monitor the heat and flip the salmon, while baking is a little more hands-off. For both methods, there is no need to remove the skin as the flesh will slide right off when ready to enjoy. The key is to keep salmon light pink, tender and flaky!

Description

This 15-minute Mediterranean salmon recipe features flaky, tender, lemony salmon topped with a juicy summer produce forward topper. Prepare it on the stove or baked in the oven for a healthy, delicious and gorgeous meal elegant enough to serve at any dinner party.






Ingredients


Scale
1x2x3x 


Salmon:
(4) 5-6 ounce salmon fillets 
2 tbsp chopped fresh oregano 
3 garlic cloves, minced 
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil + more for skillet 
Juice of one lemon 
Kosher Salt
Cracked black Pepper 
Mediterranean topper:
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
⅔ cup green California ripe olives, pitted and halved
½ English cucumber, diced 
¼ cup fresh chopped parsley
3 tbsps chopped fresh basil
½ cup crumbled feta cheese
Olive oil
Kosher salt
Cracked black pepper 





Instructions



Season Salmon: In a medium bowl, add salmon fillets. Sprinkle evenly with oregano, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice. Mix together so salmon fillets are coated. Sprinkle fillets evenly on each side with kosher salt and cracked black pepper. 
Pan Fry: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add in a drizzle of olive oil so the bottom of the pan is well coated. When the pan is hot, add salmon, skin side down and cook for 5 minutes. With a fish spatula, gently flip the salmon fillets and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on the other side.
Prepare the Mediterranean topper: While salmon is cooking, add cherry tomatoes, green California ripe olives, cucumber, parsley, basil, feta cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and season to taste with kosher salt and cracked black pepper. Mix together and set aside to top salmon. 
Finish and serve: Transfer salmon to a serving platter and top evenly with Mediterranean topper.





Notes

Baked: To bake the salmon, season as directed and preheat the oven to 425 F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and arrange fillets evenly. Bake salmon for 12-14 minutes, or until it flakes off easily with a fork.
Storage: Leftover salmon and topping is best stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Store the salmon and topping in two separate containers. I do not recommend freezing the salmon or topping.
Reheating: Reheat the leftover salmon in a 275 degree F oven, tented with foil, for about 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.

This was AMAZING and I already know it’s going into our summer dinner rotation. Used castelventrano olives which were perfect and served over couscous as mentioned. Fresh but filling, beautiful colors, and tons of flavor. Definitely a winner!!

This breakfast skillet is hands down the BEST way to cook your eggs, potatoes, bacon and cheese! What may look complicated as actually one of the most easiest recipes I’m going to make you cook. Yes. MAKE YOU. This skillet is full of golden potatoes, fried in a small amount of oil OR baked (your choice), followed closely with more crispy-ness in the form of bacon, with scallions (shallots for us Aussies) coming in third to add another layer of flavour, and THEN melted mozzarella cheese! In about 30 minutes.

Here’s the deal. I could tell you some story about how this came to be in my kitchen. But I won’t. Because boring, right? Instead, I’ll tell you how I stood around the stove, absorbing the smells of crispy, frying potatoes hovering around my face, while watching them go from pale white to the most beautiful golden brown colour, resisting the urge to dip my fingers into the skillet to grab one.

Do you ever have those moments while your cooking where you gasp, take a moment to look at what you’re creating and smile to yourself with pride? Because I had one of those. Watching the mozzarella melt all around and through the potatoes was kind of soothing.

Don’t judge me. The older I get, the more I appreciate the beauty of life. And cheese.

Oven Method:
Preheat oven to 400°F | 200°C. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer in a cast iron skillet or oven proof pan (or baking sheet). Spray with a light coating of cooking oil spray and bake for about 30 minutes, mixing them around halfway through cook time, until they are crisp and golden.
Remove from oven, add the bacon, and place back into the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the bacon is crispy.

Why this recipe works
As close to the real deal as possible.
After hours if not days of researching, watching Thai YouTube videos, and taste-testing Thai green curries from several local Thai restaurants, I feel pretty confident that this vegetarian Thai green curry is as close to the real deal as possible (and super delicious)!

You’ll get *the most amazing* fresh flavor if you make my homemade Thai green curry paste, but even a good-quality store-bought green curry paste will make this curry sing with fantastic flavor. 

The homemade paste is a labor of love, but it stays good in the fridge for 1 to 2 weeks. You can also freeze leftover paste and it tastes just as good in the curry!

Plus, the rest of the ingredients, from fresh lime leaves to Thai basil, all contribute to the characteristic flavors you love in a traditional restaurant-style Thai green curry. 

Well-balanced in flavor. 
During my time spent backpacking Thailand many years ago, I attended a weekend-long cooking retreat. The most important thing I learned was how to balance flavors to make each dish taste harmonious. 

I applied those same teachings to this vegan green curry: 

The curry paste starts things off with a baseline of spicy, pungent, salty, and slightly bitter flavors.
The fattiness from the coconut milk tempers these strong flavors, while the soy sauce adds the necessary savory punch.
A bit of coconut sugar adds sweetness to temper the fire while amping up the savoriness. 
To finish, lime leaves infuse bright citrus and a final squeeze of acidic lime juice brightens things up.
Creamy and rich. 
A classic Thai curry is full-bodied with a silky and rich mouthfeel, and this curry absolutely delivers thanks to full-fat coconut milk. 

We first tested this curry with only 1 can of coconut milk, and it was definitely lacking in texture (chunky but not creamy) and flavor (too spicy, too tangy). We found that with the amount of curry paste, tofu, and vegetables, the curry was begging for more coconut milk. 

With 2 cans, the result is nothing short of spectacular! Yes, it’s indulgent and it’s absolutely worth it!

Ingredient notes
ingredients for vegan Thai green curry on a wooden cutting board with ingredients labeled.
Green curry paste. This is the #1 essential ingredient in any Thai green curry. Green curry paste (prik gaeng khiao waan in Thai) is the spicy and fragrant base of the dish, made by pounding chiles, aromatics, herbs, and spices in a mortar and pestle. 

Choose between store-bought curry paste (convenient) or my Homemade Thai Green Curry Paste (extra delicious and fresh). 

Note: Not all store-bought green curry paste is vegan-friendly, as some contain shrimp paste. Head to the Tips section for my recommended curry paste brands. 

Coconut milk. Any Thai curry, whether green or red, requires full-fat coconut milk. Use canned coconut milk or the kind in a shelf-stable box.

Tip: Buy full-fat coconut milk in a can, not coconut cream, cream of coconut, or coconut milk in a carton. Also, choose the brand with the fewest ingredients, if possible.

Substitute: There is no substitute for coconut milk in Thai curry. That said, if you want lighten this curry up, sub ½ to 1 cup (120 to 240 mL) of the canned coconut milk with vegetable broth, vegan “chicken” broth, or water. Or, use 1 can “lite” coconut milk and 1 can full-fat coconut milk.

Lime leaves. One of the must-have ingredients in a classic Thai curry. It brings a magical citrusy aroma and that bright je nais se quois flavor you love in Thai curries.  

Where to buy: Fresh lime leaves are sold at Southeast Asian grocers and large Asian markets like HMart. They may be labeled as “lime leaves,” “makrut lime leaves,” or “kaffir lime leaves.”

Substitute: Order dried makrut lime leaves online (affiliate link). Keep them whole or gently crumble or snip each leaf to release more flavor (remove before serving).

Soy sauce. Adds the savory depth of flavor, replacing the more traditionally used ingredient, fish sauce. If you happen to have vegan fish sauce at home, go ahead and use it instead but start with less (2 to 3 teaspoons). 

Substitute: Use tamari or gluten-free soy sauce if gluten-free.

Tofu. This is the protein in our vegan green curry. To keep things quick but to improve the texture, tofu cubes are boiled in salted water to give them an enhanced chewy texture and a more enjoyable flavor. It’s the same method I use in my Tofu Curry recipe.

If you love crispy tofu and have a little extra time, pan-fry or bake the tofu instead. Instructions are in the “Can I fry or bake tofu instead?” section.  

Vegetables. You’ll find Thai or Chinese eggplant and bamboo shoots in most authentic Thai green curry recipes. You can get creative with your veggie choices if you aren’t a fan of these two—there are several options to choose from in the recipe card!

Thai basil. The Thai basil leaves are stirred into the curry at the end to give it a subtle pop of spice and notes of anise.

Substitute: Use fresh cilantro if you can’t find Thai basil.

Step-by-step instructions
Boil the tofu. Bring a pot of water to a boil. While you wait, slice the tofu into slabs and press out the excess water with a kitchen towel. Chop the slabs into ~ 3/4″ (2 cm) cubes.

Note: If you want to fry or bake the tofu instead of boiling it, see the next section.

Start the curry. Add a few spoons of the coconut milk to a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Let it bubble for a few minutes before stirring in your green curry paste (store-bought or homemade).

Note: If using store-bought curry paste, add in your extra aromatics (garlic, ginger or galangal, and lemongrass with the curry paste.

Can I fry or bake the tofu instead?
The default method—boiling the tofu—is the quickest and easiest option and still tastes delicious. Boiling the tofu in salted water makes it chewier, so it doesn’t taste like raw tofu and absorbs the curry sauce better.

That said, if you want a crispier tofu, you can definitely pan-fry or bake the tofu (or deep fry if you’re feeling frisky!).

HOW TO PAN-FRY TOFU CUBES
Slice the tofu block into 4 vertical slabs. Gently press down on them with a towel a few times to remove excess water. Weight down the slabs with a heavy cookbook and and press for 10 to 15 minutes, changing the towels in between if you can.
Chop the tofu into ~ ¾ inch (2 cm) cubes. Position the cubes together on a cutting board. Now sprinkle a few pinches of salt on the cubes. 
Heat 2 to 3 TBSP neutral-flavored oil in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.
Pack the tofu into a spider tool or slotted spoon to make it easy to add it to the pan. Once the oil is hot, add the tofu. Push the tofu around in the oil to evenly coat in one layer.
Fry until golden brown on the bottom, about 5 to 6 minutes. Take a minute or two to carefully flip each piece with a thin spatula. Cook on the second side until golden brown on the bottom, about 4 to 5 minutes. The sides won’t be fried but the crunchy-soft texture combo is great in the curry.
Transfer tofu to a paper towel lined surface to absorb oil. Push tofu pieces together and sprinkle with salt.
HOW TO BAKE TOFU CUBES
Preheat the oven to 425ºF/218ºC. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper. 
Slice the tofu into 4 vertical slabs, and gently press down on them with a towel several times to remove excess water. Press for 10 minutes, changing the towels in between. Chop the tofu ~ ¾ inch (2 cm) cubes.
In a large bowl, add the tofu, 1.5 TBSP neutral-flavored oil, 1 tsp kosher salt, and pepper to taste, tossing to coat. Add 2 TBSP arrowroot powder (or potato starch), and as gently as possible, toss with your hands. 
Arrange tofu on the pan in a single layer, spreading out the pieces so they don’t touch.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden on the bottom. Flip with a spatula or carefully turn the tofu with your hands. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes until golden and crispy.

Tips for making this recipe
Quality ingredients are essential.
To ensure you’re getting the best, take a trip to your local Southeast or pan-Asian grocery store. Gathering fresh lime leaves, lemongrass, and other aromatics is the best way to make this curry taste like the real deal.

Use homemade Thai curry paste when you have the time.
When you have more time, make this with my from-scratch Thai Green Curry Paste. It takes the flavors over the top and is guaranteed to wow your taste buds. It lends a freshness and depth of flavor that even the best store-bought curry paste can’t replicate. 

Or choose the best store-bought green curry paste you can find.
The best vegan-friendly store-bought curry paste I’ve tried is from Maesri, which is much more flavorful (and spicier) than grocery store brands (e.g., Thai Kitchen). Aroy-D also makes a good vegan one, but they sell versions with shrimp paste as well so read labels.

It’s well worth seeking out since it’s the primary flavor base in the curry. Find it online or at Asian grocery stores.

Let it rest a bit.
If you taste this curry as soon as it’s done, it may feel too spicy. Don’t worry, some spiciness mellows after the first 10 to 30 minutes and you start to taste the other flavors more.

Add lemongrass to take it over the top.
If you love lemongrass flavor, take the unused, tough stalks of lemongrass and add them to the curry when you add the coconut milk and soy sauce to infuse. Discard before serving. 

Adjust the spice level.
If making homemade green curry paste, read the tips in that post.

If using canned or jarred curry paste, and you want heat, add in a a Thai chile pepper or three (or a serrano pepper) when sautéing the curry paste and aromatics. You can also add 5 tablespoons curry paste.

Pick your preferred tofu method.
To keep things quick, opt for the boiled tofu method. If you love a crispy tofu option, pan-fry the tofu using the instructions in the recipe card.

INGREDIENTS
Green Curry Paste (Pick ONE)
▢1 batch Homemade Thai Green Curry Paste OR
▢4 to 5 tablespoons canned Thai green curry paste, plus the below ""extras"" (Note 1)
Extras if using jarred/canned curry paste
▢5 garlic cloves, minced
▢1- inch piece ginger or galangal, grated or minced
▢2 fresh lemongrass stalks, minced or grated (Note 2)
Tofu (see Note 3)
▢1 (14-ounce/400g) block of firm or extra firm tofu
▢1 tablespoon kosher salt (or ½ tablespoon sea salt)
Other Ingredients
▢1.5 OR 2 (13.5-oz/400 mL) cans of full-fat coconut milk (Note 4)
▢1 cup (240 mL) vegetable broth, vegan “chicken broth,” or water
▢8 fresh makrut (kaffir) lime leaves, bruised or crushed with your hands (Note 5)
▢1 tablespoon coconut sugar or brown sugar, more to taste
▢1 ½ tablespoons soy sauce (tamari for GF)
Vegetables of choice (more options in Note 6)
▢1 Chinese or Japanese eggplant, sliced into thin half moons (¼ to ⅛” thick / .5 cm), then sprinkled with salt for 15 minutes to soften (2 to 2 ½ cups total / ~170g)
▢1 medium or large red bell pepper, sliced
Finishing Ingredients
▢1 cup (18g) Thai basil leaves, kept whole (large leaves torn), plus more for garnish
▢Freshly squeezed lime juice (if not using lime leaves)
▢1 to 2 mild red chile peppers sliced thinly for garnish (optional, for color)
▢Cooked jasmine white rice or brown rice to serve 5
INSTRUCTIONS
Make the homemade Green Curry Paste in advance, if using.
Boil the tofu (Note 2). Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Slice the tofu into 4 vertical slabs, and gently press down with a towel several times to remove excess water. Chop into ½ to ¾-inch (~1.5 cm) cubes.
Add 1 TBSP kosher salt to boiling water (or 1 ½ to 2 tsp sea salt), followed by tofu. When water returns to a boil, set a timer for 2 minutes. Gently drain.
Heat a deep 12-inch sauté pan or medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add about 4 tablespoons of the coconut milk. Let it bubble and sizzle, and cook until the oil starts to separate from the milk, 1 ½ to 2 minutes. If it doesn’t really separate, don't worry (depends on the brand).
Add curry paste, plus extras if using store-bought curry paste. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, until it starts to dry out a bit. The curry paste might sputter so stand back. If the paste sticks, deglaze with a splash of water.
Pour in rest of the coconut milk (1.5 cans for jarred curry paste, 2 full cans for homemade curry paste). Add lime leaves, sugar, and soy sauce, and stir. Bring to a rapid simmer and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it just starts to thicken.
Add the boiled tofu (if using) and gently toss. Add vegetables of choice and broth. Stir to submerge the veg (it's okay if not totally submerged). Partially cover the pan and bring to a rapid simmer, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the veg is tender but still crisp.
If using baked or fried tofu, add it in. Taste, adding more soy sauce or sugar as needed. If you used lime leaves, remove them; if not, add a squeeze of lime juice. Stir in Thai basil. Flavors will meld and mellow a bit after 15-20 min. Serve over rice and garnish with extra basil and mild red chiles, if using.
NOTES
General Note: the prep time is if you’re using store-bought curry paste. If using homemade curry paste, it will take longer. 
1. Make sure store-bought curry paste is vegan. The best one I’ve tried is from Maesri (also available at Asian grocery stores). If you love spicy food, use 5 tablespoons of it. I don’t recommend using less than 4 TBSP because that’s where all the flavor comes from. 
2. To prep lemongrass, see the FAQ. If you only have 1 stalk, that’s fine too. 
3. The instructions here are for the boiled tofu method. If you want to pan-fry or bake the tofu for a crispy option, check out the blog post section “Can I fry or bake the tofu instead?” 
4. If using store-bought curry paste, 1.5 cans coconut milk is fine. For the homemade curry paste, 2 cans is best in my opinion. 
5. Makrut lime leaves are sold at Southeast Asian grocers and large pan-Asian markets (AKA kaffir lime leaves). If yours are very large, use fewer leaves. Can’t find them? Sub with double the dried lime leaves and tear them a bit. 
6. These are just the 2 veggies I used in photos. Some other suggestions: 
1 1/2 cups (140g) snow peas (or snap peas), trimmed
1 cup (125g) bamboo shoots, thinly sliced 
1 1/2 cups (120g) green beans, trimmed and cut into small pieces 
In general, you want to use 3 cups (300g) total of vegetables. For eggplant, use Chinese/Japanese/Thai eggplant; globe eggplants won’t soften.

Hi Melanie, we typically serve this green curry over rice as a main meal. But if you are asking about appetizers or side dishes, a Thai green papaya salad would be amazing. While not a Thai dish, these lettuce wraps with sesame-baked tofu would be a fun appetizer if you have the time to make both.

I’m a student in dorms so don’t really have access to a blender or the budget to get the ingredients for the homemade curry paste. So I made this recipe with a good quality store brought paste and it is genuinely incredible! Store brought paste on its own can be bland but the additions Nisha provides + the pan fried tofu and soy sauce really make this curry. Delicious :)

This was good, but not great as I didn’t follow the recipe exactly. I didn’t have time to get to an Asian food store, so I used jarred green curry. I also could not find lime leaves and accidentally used two full cans of coconut milk. I did like how the boiled tofu turned out, the veggies were cooked beautifully, and the curry sauce was nice, but not amazing. Your dad would not have chosen it! :) I’ll try it again on a weekend when I can do the shopping!

Loved this! I used Maesri curry paste and the extras. I opted for red pepper, Chinese eggplant, and baby bok choy for my veg and did the boiled tofu method. I couldn’t find lime leaves so used lime juice instead. The result was delicious! My husband said it was as good as our local Thai restaurant so I will definitely be making this again. Including washing and chopping the produce, the recipe took me over an hour so I’m probably not an efficient chef ;) It was worth the effort but this is probably not a weeknight meal until I figure out how to be faster.

Is there any substitute for coriander? My husband is one of those people who find the taste of it very unpleasant. I usually sub parsley in recipes but I know it doesn’t really have the same flavor.

REPLY
 KAITLIN @ RAINBOW PLANT LIFE

Hi Farza, are you referring to the coriander seeds and fresh cilantro (fresh coriander) in the homemade green curry paste? That’s the only use of coriander in this recipe. For the coriander seeds, you can just omit them entirely. For the fresh stems in the curry paste, you can use more Thai basil or also omit. There’s no cilantro or coriander required in the actual curry recipe (the curry is finished with Thai basil). Hope that helps!

Breakfast Casserole
So, I always thought I had the best breakfast casserole recipe (this overnight breakfast casserole that we make a few times a year).  I recently learned I was mistaken, because this breakfast casserole right here really is the BEST!

And, although I still really love the other recipe, this one is more of a traditional breakfast casserole, with tons of eggs, and it’s fantastic!  Plus, you can still make it the night before so it’s perfect for holidays and special events where you don’t have a lot of time to prepare in the morning.

I adapted this recipe from my sister Jessica over at Pretty Providence. I added a couple extra eggs, some milk, left out the mushrooms and cut the amount of bell peppers in half. The great thing about this recipe is how adaptable it is! It’s delicious with other types of cheese like pepperjack or Swiss, or you could try adding more veggies, like spinach or zucchini.

How to make easy breakfast casserole:
The main ingredients for this egg casserole are really simple and include: eggs, sausage, bell peppers, onion, and cheese. We add sour cream and milk to the egg mixture to make it creamy, light and fluffy.

An overhead photo of the ingredients for breakfast casserole including eggs, red and green bell pepper, green onion, sausage and shredded cheddar cheese.
To make the casserole combine the eggs, sour cream, milk, cheese, and salt and pepper in a large bowl.

Next, cook the sausage, breaking it into small bits as it’s browning.  Set it aside and then saute the bell peppers and onions in the same pan. Add everything to the egg mixture and stir to combine.  Pour it into a 9×13” pan and bake for 35-50 minutes or until the edges are set and the center is a little jiggly in the center. It will continue to cook and set up as it cools.

After baking, leftover egg casserole can be stored in the fridge and enjoyed within 3-4 days. Leftovers are delicious reheated in the microwave.

Can I make this breakfast casserole ahead of time?
Yes, you can make this breakfast casserole a day ahead, or freeze it to bake another day!

To make one day ahead of time, prepare everything as directed, up until baking. Cover the casserole and store it (unbaked) in the refrigerator overnight or up to one day. Bake in the morning, according to recipe instructions.

To freeze breakfast casserole prepare the recipe and add to your pan. Cover well with plastic wrap and then tinfoil and freeze for 2-3 months. Allow it to thaw overnight in the refrigerator, and then let it come to room temperature before baking according to recipe instructions.

Ingredients
  
1x
2x
3x
▢2 pounds pork sausage
▢12 eggs
▢1 cup sour cream (light or regular)
▢1/4 cup milk
▢salt and pepper
▢4 green onions
▢1/2 green bell pepper , diced
▢1/2 red bell pepper , diced
▢2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
Instructions
 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9x13’’ pan with cooking spray.
Combine the eggs, sour cream, milk, cheese and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix on low speed with electric mixers, just until combined.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and cook until browned, breaking it into small pieces with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Drain most of the grease and add the sausage to the bowl with the egg mixture.
Add the bell peppers and onion to the same skillet the sausage was cooked in and sauté for 2- 3 minutes. Add to the bowl with the eggs and stir everything to combine.
Pour mixture into greased 9x13’’ pan and bake for 35-50 minutes or until the edges are set and the center is just barely jiggly.

Hello. I’m planning on making this breakfast casserole on Sat morning. I know your recipe instructions calls for a glass 9×13 dish but is it possible I could you a disposable aluminum 9×13? I would just leave the pan at the brunch I am going to. This recipe looks great.

Looks great I think I will add hash browns, mushrooms and spinach to this as well. I love doing breakfast bakes. You can add pretty much what ever you want. If you choose to add hash browns to yours you may have to add more eggs to saturate the entire thing.

Lower the heat down to a gentle simmer.STEP 2Break the Freshlay Farms Golden Yolker eggs into four separate coffee cups or ramekins. Split the muffins, toast them for a few minutes either side and warm some plates.To make the hollandaise:STEP 1Melt the butter in a saucepan and skim any white solids from the surface. Keep the butter warm.STEP 2Put the egg yolks, white wine or tarragon vinegar, a pinch of salt and a splash of ice-cold water in a metal or glass bowl that will fit over a small pan. Whisk for a few minutes, then put the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and whisk continuously until pale and thick, about 3-5 mins.STEP 3Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the melted butter bit by bit until it’s all incorporated and you have a creamy hollandaise. (If it gets too thick, add a splash of water.) Season with a squeeze of lemon juice and a little cayenne pepper. Keep warm until needed.To make the eggs benedict:STEP 1Swirl the simmering vinegared water briskly to form a vortex and slide in an egg. It will curl round and set to a neat round shape. Cook for 2-3 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon.STEP 2Repeat with the other eggs, one at a time, re-swirling the water as you slide in the eggs. Spread some sauce on each muffin, scrunch a slice of ham on top, then top with an egg.

Russian Cheese Pancakes (Syrniki)




















5.0

(6)

5 Reviews

4 Photos



Syrniki are traditional pancakes from Russia that are usually served for breakfast with jam or sour cream. They're made with a cheese called tvorog, but you can use farmer's cheese or quark, which are the closest substitutions in the U.S.

Break the eggs into a small bowl, season with salt and black pepper and whisk to combine. 

Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. 

Add the spinach and stir until it wilts.  This will take about 2 minutes.

Add the eggs to the pan and stir to combine with the spinach and to allow the eggs to reach the bottom of the pan.  Allow to cook for a minute or two, stirring occasionally. 

When the eggs are just about set, remove the pan from the heat.  Stir through the cheese and sprinkle over some chilli flakes.

Serve with wholemeal toast.

Dairy Free
Healthy Grilled Chicken and Veggie Wrap

June 24, 2019January 26, 2022 


This delicious and healthy grilled chicken and veggie wrap is dairy free, easily gluten free, loaded with flavour and made in just 3 easy steps!
 
Healthy Grilled Chicken and Veggie Wrap 
 
More than any other time of year I think Summer is the season of “on-the-go”. There’s road trips, pool days, picnics, and a million other activities that keep everyone moving and out and about enjoying the warm weather and sunshine. That’s why I think having delicious and healthy portable snacks and meal options are key. Otherwise, we make less healthy choices when hunger hits or forget to eat altogether, which is never a good thing. Wraps are the ultimate on-the-go lunch or dinner. You can stuff them full of healthy proteins, fats, veggies, and delicious flavours then literally…wrap it all up to go! 
The recipe I’m sharing today is actually an older one from the blog that has stayed popular over the years and definitely deserves a big revamp, new photos, and time in the spotlight again, especially for summer. This healthy grilled chicken and veggie wrap is a grilling dream as it’s not just the chicken that’s grilled to perfection, the veggies and then the whole wrap gets grilled too! While you can definitely toss the chicken and veggies on the barbecue (or even in the oven), the ultimate tool for this recipe is the Cuisinart Griddler 5 I got from The Brick.
 
The Great Griddler
 
This nifty little kitchen appliance has been getting a workout lately as I’ve been grilling up chicken, veggies, and burgers on it, using the flat plates to make pancakes and also using it as a sandwich and wrap panini press. My hubby loves tuna melts and he’s been making them on the regular using the Griddler too.

The reason it’s called a “Cuisinart Griddler 5” is because it has the capacity to cook 5 different ways. You can use it as a contact grill, panini (or wrap) press, full grill, full griddle (flat rather than ridged, as the grill plates are reversible) and a half grill or griddle. One tool, five uses. That’s what I call convenience and space saving!

The Ultimate Chicken Wrap in Three Steps
 
This delicious and healthy chicken and veggie wrap comes together in three simple steps: 

 Grill the chicken and veggies.
 Add the ingredients to a tortilla wrap.
 Grill/press the wrap. 


The result is a crunchy wrap with a super flavourful filling mixed with sweet balsamic glaze, Italian seasoning, and if you prefer, feta cheese or a dairy-free cheese of choice. I love the Mediterranian inspired flavours, that the wrap is well balanced with protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fibre, and that it’s so easy to take on-the-go. Enjoy it hot off the griddler or cold if you store in the fridge for later, it’s delicious and healthy either way. 

This is the third recipe I’ve created in partnership with The Brick and I’ve honestly had so much fun using their amazing small kitchen appliances. Each kitchen tool has multiple uses and really works to save time, space, and money, not to mention inspire healthy cooking and eating. I’ve whipped up No-Bake Peanut Butter Energy Balls with the super sleek Cuisinart Custom Food Processor, Shredded Chicken Tinga Tacos with the Cuisinart Precision Master Stand Mixer, and now this Healthy Grilled Chicken and Veggie Wrap with the Cuisinart Griddler-5! 

Pack a Grilled Chicken and Veggie Wrap for lunch along with some Peanut Butter Energy Balls for a snack, enjoy it all on-the-go and come back home to make some easy Tinga Tacos for supper. Sounds like my kind of summer day, don’t you agree??
 Healthy Grilled Chicken and Veggie Wrap       Print     Cook time  20 mins    Total time  20 mins       Author: Christal Sczebel Serves: 2   Ingredients  1 tablespoon olive oil ½ cup sliced mushrooms ½ zucchini, cut lengthwise into strips ½ cup cherry tomatoes, halved ¼ cup sliced red onion ½ bell pepper, sliced into strips 2  4oz skinless boneless chicken breasts 3 tablespoons balsamic glaze (like balsamic vinegar but a thicker consistency, like honey) 1 teaspoon italian seasoning ¼ cup chopped fresh basil salt and pepper 2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese or dairy free cheese of choice (I used a dairy free feta, shredded mozzarella would be great too!) 2 large whole grain or gluten free tortilla wraps     Instructions  Preheat the griddler/grill to 400 degrees. In a large bowl toss the vegetables with the olive oil, 1 tablespoon of balsamic glaze, ½ teaspoon italian seasoning, and salt and pepper. On a plate, season the chicken breast with the remaining italian seasoning and salt and pepper as well as a drizzle of olive oil. Spread the vegetables out over the heated grill and place the chicken breasts on the grill next to the veggies. Close the griddler so the top plate is just resting on the chicken breasts and grill everything for 15 minutes, slightly tossing the veggies every 5 minutes or so. After grilling for 15 minutes check that the chicken is completely cooked through, and if it’s not, transfer the grilled veggies to a bowl and continue cooking the chicken until completely cooked through (cooking time will be dependant on the thickness of your chicken breast). Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a plate and let cool for 5 minutes then slice and divide the chicken breast and veggies between two large tortilla wraps. Sprinkle the basil over the chicken and veggies and add the cheese if using. Fold in the outer edges of the tortilla wrap and roll to enclose the chicken and veggie filling inside each tortilla wrap. Place the wraps on the hot giddler and close the top to use the griddler as a panini press to grill the wrap on both sides. Grill the wraps for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. Remove from heat and enjoy or wrap in foil and save in the fridge for later or to take on-the-go.    3.5.3251

When you're short on time or patience, waiting an hour or more for an oven-baked potato might seem like a tall order. That's why this recipe is so darn good – you can have a perfectly microwaved baked potato in just a little more than 10 minutes! It sounds too good to be true but, we promise, this recipe is just as good as reviewers say it is.


   How to Make a Baked Potato In the Microwave  










DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS



It couldn't be easier to microwave baked potatoes. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:


  Prep Potato  

Scrub your potato under running water, prick it with a fork, then place it on a microwave-safe plate.


  Cook and Cut  

Microwave for about 5 minutes, flip it over, and microwave it for about 5 more minutes. Let the potato cool for just a few minutes, until it's safe to handle. Cut the potato lengthwise so that it opens and forms a natural bowl.


  Finish With Toppings  

Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then mash the inside with a fork. Top with butter and Cheddar, then return to the microwave to melt the cheese. Finish it with sour cream and the toppings of your choice.


   How Long to Microwave Baked Potatoes  

We find that this 10-minute method works well to create a perfectly tender baked potato – 5 minutes on one side, 5 minutes on the other. However, not all microwaves cook at exactly the same power. If you've found in the past that your microwave is more or less powerful than other microwaves, you may want to adjust the recipe by a few minutes.


   Best Potatoes for Baked Potatoes  

This microwave baked potato recipe calls for a russet potato, and we think that's the best way to go. Russets have thick skin that crisps up nicely in the microwave or in the oven. Plus, they have super starchy insides that'll ensure a perfectly fluffy filling.



Technically, though, you can use any starchy potato you have on hand.


   Baked Potato Toppings  

Classic baked potato toppings include sour cream, Cheddar, crumbled bacon, and fresh chives. You can get as creative as you want, though! Try chili and shredded cheese for a fun take on a classic comfort food, cooked pulled pork and barbecue sauce to satisfy a barbecue craving, or pico de gallo and black beans for a Mexican-inspired option.


   What to Serve With Baked Potatoes  

You can eat these microwave baked potatoes as a meal by themselves. Just dress it up with toppings and you're good to go (throw in a Caesar salad or roasted veggies to add a little color to your plate). However, many people like to serve baked potatoes as a side dish, paired with hearty meat-based entrees. If you're in need of a little inspiration, try one of these delicious ideas:

   Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  

""This was great,"" according to VIOLETSIVA. ""One tip – if you want your potatoes to come out extra 'steamy' and have problems with your potatoes drying out, try wrapping the potatoes in plastic wrap before microwaving. The skin doesn't dry out and get crisp, but the inner part comes out the way it does in the oven.""



""Yum,"" says ecphan. ""Great recipe! I've been looking for a good microwave baked potato recipe (I'm too lazy to oven bake them). This is very good. I've never tried a baked potato with cheese on it...I've been missing out. It adds a whole different dimension to the flavor.""



""This was soooo good,"" raves newtshe. ""I used olive oil and oregano to flavor the potato. Another reviewer added a tip to place a bit of water on the bottom of the plate to prevent drying out and it worked. Will be cooking another one tomorrow.""

A Reuben sandwich is one of my family's fix-it-quick favorites. They are really delicious and easy to make. I like to serve them with big bowls of steaming vegetable soup and dill pickles on the side.

Make a deli-style Reuben sandwich at home with this top-rated Reuben recipe.












Mike Phillips


   What Is a Reuben Sandwich?  

A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.


   What Is On a Reuben?  

A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.












abapplez


   How to Make a Reuben  

You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make reuben sandwiches at home:



1. Spread the dressing on one side of each slice of bread.2. Assemble the sandwiches. Butter the top of each sandwich.3. Place the sandwich butter-side down on the hot skillet or griddle.4. Butter the other side. Flip when the bottom slice is golden brown.5. Grill until both sides are golden brown.

   How to Serve Reuben Sandwiches  

Pair your Reuben with a pickle, potato chips, French fries, or one of these classic deli sides:

   Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  

""This recipe was so good,"" says Cheri Lind. ""My family loved it and I will definitely make it again. It was so easy and quick to make.""



""Here's a tip that works for all grilled sandwiches: Instead of butter, spread the outside of the bread with a thin layer of mayonnaise,"" according to Sudie B. ""It makes a lovely, crispy sandwich, and no one will guess you used mayo.""



""These sandwiches were super easy to make,"" says Mindy Holley Thornton. ""Tasted just as good, if not better, than at a restaurant.""



Editorial contributions by Corey Williams












Ingredients



8 slices rye bread


½ cup Thousand Island dressing


8 slices Swiss cheese


8 slices deli sliced corned beef


1 cup sauerkraut, drained


2 tablespoons butter, softened






Directions




Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.





Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing. On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.





Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.
















Editor's Note

Try this sauerkraut recipe and top with homemade Thousand Island dressing.

Need an egg dish for breakfast? Make these veggie stuffed omelet that’s ready in just 15 minutes.
by Betty Crocker Kitchens Updated Mar 26, 2013
Ingredients
1
teaspoon olive or canola oil
2
tablespoons chopped red bell pepper
1
tablespoon chopped onion
1/4
cup sliced mushrooms
1
cup loosely packed fresh baby spinach leaves, rinsed
1/2
cup fat-free egg product or 2 eggs, beaten
1
tablespoon water
Dash salt
Dash pepper
1
tablespoon shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Steps
1
In 8-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, onion and mushrooms to oil. Cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until onion is tender. Stir in spinach; continue cooking and stirring just until spinach wilts. Remove vegetables from pan to small bowl.
2
In medium bowl, beat egg product, water, salt and pepper with fork or whisk until well mixed. Reheat same skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly pour egg mixture into pan. While sliding pan back and forth rapidly over heat, quickly stir with spatula to spread eggs continuously over bottom of pan as they thicken. Let stand over heat a few seconds to lightly brown bottom of omelet. Do not overcook; omelet will continue to cook after folding.
3
Place cooked vegetable mixture over half of omelet; top with cheese. With spatula, fold other half of omelet over vegetables. Gently slide out of pan onto plate. Serve immediately.
Tips from the Betty Crocker Kitchens
tip 1
To make 2 omelets, double all of the ingredients, cooking egg mixture in 2 batches. Keep the first omelet warm by placing on a warm plate. Topping each omelet with about 1 tablespoon salsa or hot sauce adds an extra burst of flavor.

Cheesy Roasted Broccoli & Chickpea Kale Salad
GFVGVDFNSJump to Recipe

If you’ve never tried crispy CHEESY roasted broccoli, you’re in for a treat. 
Especially when it’s paired with crispy roasted chickpeas, citrus-massaged kale (yeah, we said it), and our 5-minute SMOKY Chipotle Dressing! 
Friends, let us show you how easy this 30-minute dish is!









The first step is to roast the broccoli and chickpeas on a large baking sheet. 
The broccoli is seasoned with avocado oil, salt, and pepper, then topped with nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor!
Chickpeas get coated in avocado oil, salt, and a blend of smoky spices (cumin, smoked paprika, and chili powder). Next, into the oven they go for about 20 minutes or until crispy and browned!

While the chickpeas and broccoli are cooking, the kale is massaged with lime juice, sea salt, chili powder, and maple syrup. This helps it soften and infuses it with flavor. 

Then you’re ready for assembly! The roasted chickpeas and broccoli are added to the massaged kale along with carrots for sweetness, avocado for richness, and sunflower seeds for a little crunch.
For dressing, you can choose either our 5-Minute Smoky Chipotle Dressing or Quick Ginger Garlic Miso Tahini Dressing. Both are delicious, but we especially love the smokiness of the chipotle with this salad!

We hope you LOVE this kale salad! It’s:CheesyCrunchyFlavorfulFreshSmokyCustomizableHearty& Satisfying!
It’s delicious as a standalone meal. Or, for more protein, top with smoky tempeh, black bean falafel, or chicken. We also think it would pair well with our Smoky Grilled Eggplant.

IngredientsUS Customary – MetricBROCCOLI1 large head broccoli, chopped into medium florets  (~3 heaping cups)1 Tbsp avocado oil1 healthy pinch each sea salt and black pepper1-2 Tbsp nutritional yeastCHICKPEAS1 15-oz can chickpeas, rinsed, drained, and dried1 Tbsp avocado oil1/4 tsp sea salt1 tsp ground cumin1 tsp smoked paprika1 tsp chili powder (chili powder should contain a blend of spices, such as chili powder, oregano, cumin, and garlic)GREENS1 large bundle curly or dinosaur kale, chopped  (large bottom stalks removed)3 Tbsp lime juice1 healthy pinch sea salt1/2 tsp chili powder  (chili powder should contain a blend of spices, such as chili powder, oregano, cumin, and garlic)1 tsp maple syrupTHE REST1 cup shredded carrots  (~2 carrots)1 ripe avocado, sliced1/4 cup roasted or raw sunflower seeds  (or sub other nut or seed)DRESSING (choose one)5-Minute Smoky Chipotle DressingGinger Miso Dressing
InstructionsHeat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add the broccoli and drizzle with oil and top with salt, pepper, and nutritional yeast. Toss to combine and move to one side of the baking sheet.Add the rinsed, dried chickpeas to a mixing bowl and top with oil, salt, cumin, paprika, and chili powder. Toss to combine (they should be very well coated). Then add to the other side of the baking sheet. Bake for about 20 minutes or until broccoli and chickpeas are browned.In the meantime, add chopped kale to a serving bowl and top with lime, salt, chili powder, and maple syrup (trust us — we know it sounds weird). Massage for 1-2 minutes to infuse the spices and acidity into the greens. This paired with sweetness from the maple syrup makes the kale irresistible!Next, prep carrots and dressing of choice. We highly recommend the smoky chipotle dressing, but both options are delicious! Set aside.To assemble salad, top the kale with the shredded carrots, roasted broccoli and chickpeas, sliced avocado, and sunflower seeds. Toss with dressing or serve on the side.Best when fresh but leftovers keep in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days (dressings will keep 4-5 days stored separately). No freezer friendly.

Wow, this was one of the BEST kale salad recipes I’ve ever tried! The kale was amazingly tasty (as was everything else). For the sauce I subbed the cashew butter for almond and the adobo for chili powder – so good!! I will definitely be making this often!

Had a week of eating junk after a party we hosted and had too many leftovers. I desperately needed something green and delicious. This fit perfectly! I subbed almond butter for cashew butter in the dressing and upped the lime juice but this was a perfect meal and great for leftovers for 3 days. So good!

Really loved this salad. Never liked raw kale but massaging it is genius! Completely transforms it. Love the nutritional yeast flavor. Would love a recipe/ratios to make my own chili powder (in Australia, can only fine plain chili powder, not mixed with garlic, oregano and cumin etc)

OMG!! This is salad just made my week, ya’ll! I set a goal to up my vegetable intake this week and the thought of eating heaps of raw veggies made me slightly miserable. But this salad has turned my frown upside down. I didn’t have the ingredients to make a dressing so used one I had on hand and it was still divine. I will be making this one regularly. Thanks again, Minimalist Baker, for a fantastic recipe!

So enjoyed this recipe! Fabulous flavours and great mix of textures too.  Made the ginger miso dressing which was so good I just wanted to eat the whole lot with a spoon (but managed to refrain). Used half peanut butter and half tahini in the dressing. Loved it all. Will be making regularly. Great success. Thank you!

This is fantastic! My only issue is that I can’t stop eating it! I do like it better without the maple syrup in the kale, the second time I made it I just used olive oil, salt, lemon and nooch on the kale, but that’s just a taste preference. I didn’t have all the items for either of the dressings, so I just made a simple tahini dressing and it was still delicious. This will become a new favorite.

The most delicious bowl I’ve had in a long time! All of the flavors and textures were incredible together. Only change I made was swapping cashew butter for tahini in the dressing and it was delicious! Thanks for a simple yet amazing recipe!

Absolutely DELISH! I’m on the Radical Metabolism eating plan right now and only had to make 2 small substitutions. I eliminated the nutritional yeast and added grated parmesan to the finished salad. And on the Garlic Miso Tahinini Dressing I sub’d Lankanto Maple syrup. So YUMMY! Can’t wait to make it again!
Timing on Recipe was correct too, about 45 minutes for me.

I have been enjoying your recipes for years and in addition to your cookbook like to print recipes.  The new print font doesn’t work as well for me — it takes too much paper and is hard to keep in a binder.
But the content is top-notch!  My family loves it when I make your recipes.
Thanks!

Excellent recipe!

I happen to have everything to make this tonight. WOW, delicious delicious!! Only thing I did different is put my Kale in my food processor. We find that finely chopped Kale is yummy. You can use more of the Kale (stems and green) and it’s easy to eat. I didn’t have Avocado oil so Olive oil worked fine. Will definitely make this again. Thank You, we enjoy A LOT of your recipes!!

Loved this and the interesting flavor combinations. Made with the black bean falafel as suggested. Didn’t think I’d ever see my 8 year old go for seconds of kale. (The maple syrup may have come in handy there ;-)

This was really delicious but I had to make some changes just because of ingredients I was missing. I made the broccoli and chick peas according to the instructions. Delish!
I didn’t have any Kale so made brown rice and mixed in the cashew butter dressing as well as the shredded carrots and roasted pepitas.
I will make this again and will try it with the kale too

Hello Minimalist Baker
I love your site and the beautiful presentations you make . I wonder would it be possible for those who are watching their lipid intake ( just getting on in years or high cardiovascular risk ) to do a low fat version of your salads too. Based on the fat in this lovely salad , I make it to be 59% of total calories – even if much of it the healthier polyunsaturated kind. Easing back on nuts and avocado and removing the oil will work wonders  and I am going to try that version but it would be worthwhile flagging this OR also trying the lower fat version too . With sincere good wishes and thanks for all your delicious ideas  John

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

Hi John! Great question. On this one in particular, I’d say water down the dressing so it’s thinner, and omit (or cut way down on) oil when cooking the chickpeas and broccoli. Also omit sunflower seeds. Hope that helps!

This was so good! Made the salad for lunch today.  My only subs were frozen green beans instead of broccoli and I used tahini for the chipotle dressing. I also left out the maple syrup in the kale and added extra lime juice. Super delicious combo of flavors and very filling. Thank you Dana!

Start the sauce in the next step, and start cooking the pasta when the water boils.Step 2Combine garlic and 4 tablespoons of the oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the garlic, pressing it into the oil occasionally to release its flavor; it should barely color on both sides. Remove the garlic, and add the remaining oil.Step 3Fry the eggs gently in the oil, until the whites are just about set and the yolks still quite runny. Drain the pasta, and toss with the eggs and oil, breaking up the whites as you do. (The eggs will finish cooking in the heat of the pasta.)

When pasta is ready mix everything together in another bowl (not a hot one) and mix well. If you like you can add more cheese. This is ""Pasta alla carbonara"". Very popular in Italy. In my recipe the egg is added raw, and it gets slightly cooked by the contact with hot pasta.Is this helpful? 636Midge6 years agoI've been making this for years and have discovered you get a better result by separating the eggs, cooking only the whites, then adding the raw yolks at the end. Whites get fully cooked, and raw yolks better coat the pasta. I don't find the cheese to be necessary.  My favored pasta is Manischewitz extra-wide egg noodles.Is this helpful? 586ellen6 years agoany time pasta (macaroni, no matter the shape, when I was growing up) is involved, it's delicious.  Period.  Pasta and wet cement.  Pasta and dried leaves.  sprinkle with toasted bread crumbs, too....Is this helpful? 511Stephane6 years agoThis is not carbonara. It is easier and more straightforward. It's an emergency dish, one you do when you have no time or special food in your fridge, such as pancetta and pecorino.Don't do it for more than 3 people, or it won't work. Use thick spaghetti, cut the garlic thinly, fry it gently and let it in the pan, keep the yolk liquid, add a bit of salt and lots of pepper. Amazing, thanks for the recipeIs this helpful? 437Jackie Seal6 years agoWhat is this thing you call ""leftover pasta""?!?:)Is this helpful? 279jmee5 years agoI was home alone and feeling sorry for myself and this recipe made the world right again. I had a tin of anchovies open so added one to the oil, along with some green onions that were wilting in the frig and a dash of red pepper flakes. Delicious and comforting. Next time I feel a funk coming on I'll reach for this recipe again.Is this helpful? 213Kemala Tribe6 years agoMade this for years for my little egg loving son - to the point of intentionally setting aside dinner pasta for the next morning.  Why make it complicated? Throw leftover pasta in skillet with a little heated oil (a tiny bit of water helps if spaghetti is stuck together, as another commented noted), crack your eggs into the skillet, swirl it around a bit, add cheese of choice. Done. Delish. No garlic for breakfast at my house, but that's just me. Dinner's a different matter.Is this helpful? 166Max6 years agoYou can also simply cook pasta, drain it, then stir in an egg.  This results in a creamy egg coating over the pasta.  The heat of the pasta alone will completely cook the egg.  I usually grind a bunch of fresh pepper on top.  Parmesan if you have it is a great addition as is a little heavy cream.Is this helpful? 148annie6 years agoIt takes a little practice to time the eggs so they're not overcooked before adding to the pasta, but it's a favorite and last-minute dinner standby in my house. But, I don't understand why you'd toss out the garlic! Add it to the dish and it just adds more flavor.Is this helpful? 120Lewis6 years agoEasy and very good. We added some chopped tomatoes, capers, chopped green olives and a little soprasetta to the pan before we fried the eggs.Is this helpful? 102Jennifer6 years agoGreat as-is or with substitutions/embellishments.  Two things I like to do whether I am embellishing or not are: (1) add a pinch of Italian seasoning, which I always have on hand; and (2) drain the pasta only slightly or add back in some pasta water to make the dish a bit saucy.  I put everything back in the pot I cooked the pasta in, rather than add the pasta to the eggs in the skillet.Is this helpful? 96Gregg McKee6 years agoI like it best with addition of red pepper flakes.Is this helpful? 89David6 years agoYou can also simply cook pasta, drain it, then stir in an egg.

Used thin spaghetti for ""fluffier"" mouthfeel, included cheese (necessary, IMO). Timing on eggs a bit tricky, to have them end at the same time as pasta and still be runny. Did a quick over-easy to get the raw white on the top (around yolk) to cook. Finished in fry pan (for drier texture) with a splash of pasta water and generous dusting of cheese and pepper, and drizzle raw olive oil. Fab!Is this helpful? 66Apples'nOranges4 years agoI like to add a handful or two of baby spinach, chopped with a couple of scallions, right as the eggs are going to come out of the skillet.Is this helpful? 66Cooker Ash3 days agoI would recommend leaving the garlic in (or at least some of it) and I always top with fresh parsley - adds a bit of colour and flavour!Is this helpful?John2 weeks agoSo, I take it the garlic isn't added, but used to flavor the oil?Is this helpful?Sharon4 weeks agoI used gluten free egg fettuccine which cooked in 3 minutes. Added the garlic to the oil and the noodles as soon as the garlic started to change color. Scrambled the eggs slightly and mixed into the noodles. Some salt and pepper and then grated parmesan and thinly sliced green onions. Oh. My. Had to force myself to stop eating. 

Yum.,Is this helpful?Tj1 month agoI add hot sauce (red hot) and parm after serving it, and while cooking the egg season with a bit of MSG and cayenne pepper. So flavorful and deep but probably one of the easiest dishes to cook up and very filling!Is this helpful?Ed Z.2 months agoWhat happens to the garlic? Did you (gasp!) discard??? Or (ahhh...) add back as a topping? I think we all know the correct answer here.Is this helpful?pastalober2 months agoI love this meal. Super quick, especially if you use fresh pasta, which cooks in 2-5 minutes. It’s so versatile. You can use whatever noodles you have on hand, including soba, spinach, and other flavors. You can add some browned bacon, ham, guanciale, or other for a fake carbonara. I also confess to eating leftovers for breakfast…if there are leftovers, which isn’t often!Is this helpful?Mimi2 months agoSo yummy! I reserved yolks and started cooking whites first, then added pasta, poured yolks on top, (turned stove off), and quickly stirred everything while breaking up whites and preventing yolks from clumping - to keep smooth and creamy. Tasted like a good carbonara because whites were cooked and not throwing off the flavour of yolks. I forgot to add the remaining olive oil before whites so dumped a bit in after yolks, and a bit of pasta water. Will make again!Is this helpful? 1Sue3 months agoI added a touch of basil oil to the finished product. Delish!Is this helpful?Hamotron3 months agoWe find that reducing the olive oil and adding the eggs a little rawer gives best results- we also like to increase the number of eggs.Is this helpful? 1nicole3 months agoThis needs hot sauce! Or some kind of chili sauceIs this helpful?Stacey3 months agoPerfect weeknight dish. Of course I doctored it up a little by adding a couple of anchovies, since I had them on hand. But the real star here was the eggs. My hens lay some pretty nice ones, and this recipe was the perfect way to take advantage of those bright orange yolks and super fresh whites. This one's a keeper.Is this helpful?Michelle5 months agoThis dinner was so simple, but so delicious. The timing can definitely be a little tricky, but the end result was fantastic.Is this helpful?Eileen5 months agoMy thrifty mother made a filling meal by frying cold cooked egg noodles in butter and folding in beaten eggs.

A tried and true favorite, this cinnamon raisin oatmeal is absolutely delicious and comes together in less than 10 minutes. It’s loaded with tons of cinnamon goodness and tastes just like an oatmeal raisin cookie. Vegan + gluten-free.

This cinnamon raisin oatmeal recipe is an EBF original and has stood the test of time. I used to make it ALL THE TIME as it was my go-to breakfast for quite a few years and it’s still just as delicious as I remember!

Why You’ll Love This Recipe
Oats provide a good amount of vitamins, minerals, fiber and even antioxidants. They are basically a “super grain.”
It tastes like you’re eating an oatmeal raisin cookie, but in the form of a warm, comforting bowl of oats.
It’s totally customizable – feel free to switch up the toppings and mix-ins.
This recipe comes together in under 15 minutes!
Ingredients measured out to make cinnamon raisin oatmeal: cinnamon, sea salt, banana, maple syrup, oats, raisins, coconut butter, non-dairy milk and ground flaxseed.
Ingredients Needed
old fashioned oats – old fashioned rolled oats are best for this recipe. Make sure you grab gluten-free oats if needed. I use Bob’s Red Mill gluten-free rolled oats. If you have steel cut oats, try my recipe for steel cut oatmeal.
banana – you’ll cook some banana slices right with the oats. The end result is a slightly sweet, creamy bowl of oats. I like to top with additional banana slices as well.
raisins – look for unsweetened raisins! You’ll cook the raisins in the oatmeal as well so that delicious flavor gets mixed in throughout the oats. You can also top your oats with additional raisins!
ground flaxseed – these little seeds add a bit of fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Feel free to use chia seeds if you don’t have flaxseed on hand.
cinnamon – the perfect spice pairing for this oatmeal! I love the combination of raisins and cinnamon.
sea salt – brings all of the flavors together.
water or non-dairy milk – I typically cook my oats in water but if you want an extra creamy bowl, you can use dairy-free milk. My preference is unsweetened almond milk.
coconut butter or any nut/seed butter – optional topping but I love adding a coconut butter or nut butter drizzle to my oats!
maple syrup – pure maple syrup is the perfect natural sweetener to use because it’s liquid so it blends in nicely with the oat mixture and I personally love the flavor.

Customize Your Cinnamon Raisin Oatmeal
Toppings – This oatmeal has a delicious base recipe that you can build your own flavors on – but the toppings change depending on what I have on hand. This time around I used maple syrup, banana slices, raisins, coconut butter and a dash of cinnamon, but feel free to get creative with the toppings! If you really want to stick with the cinnamon raisin theme, my cinnamon raisin almond butter would be a delicious addition instead of the coconut butter.

Overnight Oats – You could use these ingredients to make a delicious overnight oats recipe if that’s more your style.

How to Make Cinnamon Raisin Oatmeal
Making this cinnamon raisin oatmeal is a breeze. Start by combining the oats, banana slices, raisin, flaxseed, cinnamon, sea salt and water to a pot and stir to combine. Heat over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes or until all of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir the oats several times during cooking to make sure the banana slices melt into the oats. The oatmeal is cooked when the liquid is absorbed and the oats are thick and fluffy! Spoon the oats into a bowl and top with coconut butter, maple syrup, banana slices and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

This recipe is for a single serving but you can double, triple or more if you’re cooking for a crowd!

pro tip! 
Don't forget to stir your oatmeal a few times while cooking so the bananas don't burn or stick to the bottom!

Shredded Chicken Burrito Recipe:
This shredded chicken and rice one-pan burrito recipe is very easy to make. This meal is full of juicy chopped chicken, salsa, easy spices and rice. Then you roll all the ingredients in a flour tortilla for an easy weeknight meal.

What I love about this recipe is that you can eat the chicken in many different ways. Make taco, have burrito bowls or make it a low carb night and top with cheese.

We can eat chicken made with salsa and Mexican spices anytime of the week. This is a great way to jazz up your chicken for an easy one-pan meal.

Close up image of chicken and rice burritos stacked. 
Easy Weeknight Meal:
My family is busy with work, school and sports. One-pan meals have saved me so much time and money. Plus this recipes combines all my family favorites together in one pan.

You start by cooking the chicken in the pan and then adding in the salsa and the seasoning. Once that is made, we keep the rice and beans separate but you could heat everything together if you prefer.

Close up image of chicken and rice burritos stacked. 
Can I use Taco Seasoning instead?
Yes, you can use taco seasoning instead of the individual seasoning. The packet taco seasoning is an easy choice, but did you know you can make your own Homemade Taco Seasoning.

It taste so much better than the packet seasoning that you by at the store and it is really easy to make. I love making a big batch of seasoning and it will usually last me all month.

Ingredients needed - chicken, onion, olive oil, garlic salt, chili powder, cumin, paprika, diced tomatoes, salsa, refried beans, tortillas, mexican rice, cheese. 
Ingredients for Skillet Chicken and Rice Burrito Recipe:
Chicken Breasts
Onion
Olive Oil
Garlic Salt 
Chili Powder 
Cumin 
Paprika 
Diced Tomatoes
Salsa 
Refried Beans 
Burrito Size Flour Tortillas 
Mexican Rice 
Cheddar Cheese, shredded 
How do you make Chicken and Rice burritos?
Prepare Skillet for Cooking Chicken – Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and diced onion. Sauté the chicken with the onion for 3-5 minutes until the chicken is browned. I like to season the chicken with salt and pepper.
Stir in Ingredients – Then stir in the salsa, diced tomatoes, seasoning and water. You can also use chicken broth instead of water. Cover and bring to a boil for 7-10 minutes until the chicken is tender and cooked through.
Close up image of skillet of cooked chicken with the salsa ingredients. 
Prepare the Beans and Rice – Heat the refried beans and Spanish rice in separate bowls.
Heat the Tortillas – You can heat the tortillas for 30-45 seconds in the microwave so that they are pliable.
Start Making your Burritos – Place 1 of the tortillas in a flat surface. Spread 1-2 tablespoon of the refried beans on the center of the tortilla. Then top with 1/4-⅓ cup of the Spanish rice.
Top with Chicken – Then place approximately ¼ cup of the chicken mixture in each burrito and top it with the shredded cheese.
Heat Skillet – Heat a large skillet over medium high heat.
Brown Burrito in a Skillet – Wrap the burrito filling and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side until brown slightly.
Serve and Enjoy – Serve with your favorite taco toppings and enjoy!
Tips for the best Skillet Chicken Burritos:
Cook in Iron Skillet – We love cooking in our iron skillet. We recommend using an iron skillet when making this skillet chicken burritos.
Top over Rice – Instead of serving in burrito serve over white rice for burrito bowls.
Mix beans in Skillet – Add your beans to the chicken, salsa mixture. We prefer to use black beans but you can also use pinto beans.
Cut chicken – When preparing your chicken, make sure to cut in bite size piece so that it cooks evenly. It is also to easier to top your tortilla so that it is easier to eat.
Spice it up – If you prefer to have it a little bit spicier you can use a can of rotel instead of diced tomatoes. I have even tossed in some cayenne pepper with the salsa to make it a bit spicier. You can start with a teaspoon and add more if needed.
Use Cooked Chicken – If you already have cooked chicken, then you can skip the step to cook the chicken. Just toss all the ingredients at once and make sure your chicken gets heated.
Close up image of chicken and rice burritos stacked. 
Can I make this recipe in the slow cooker?
Yes, you can. This would be a great recipe to place in the crock pot and have it ready when you get home. Place the chicken, seasoning, onions and garlic, and salsa in the crock pot.

Cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 4-6 hours. Once chicken is cook, shred the chicken.

You can still build your burrito with the rice and beans and then top with the shredded chicken mixture.

Variation for Skillet Chicken and Rice:
This is the perfect meal to cook one and eat twice. So many different options to use your leftover chicken. I love to double the recipe so I can use for another meal.

Flour or Corn Tortillas
Taco Shells
Taco Salad
Burritos
Nachos
Burrito Bowl
The options are endless.

Topping Ideas for Chicken Burrito Skillet:

You can also freeze this yummy recipe. Make sure to freeze in a airtight container to enjoy later.

Made this tonight. Added a can of pinto beans rinsed. The best burritos I’ve ever had!

This sounds very easy and yummy, but I am trying to figure out the ingredient, Mexican rice. I just have leftover plain rice, wouldn’t the spices and tomato in this recipe be enough to flavor the dish? Would I need to add extra?

Preparation steps

shrimp and egg stir fry brings together soft scrambled eggs, succulent shrimp, and scallions in creating the ultimate comfort meal for the weekdays. Made in a single pan with a handful of ingredients, this simple and delicious meal is iconic for its savory flavors and melt-in-your-mouth texture.What is Shrimp and Egg Stir-Fry?Shrimp and egg stir-fry, also known as scrambled eggs with shrimp (虾仁炒蛋) is one of the most popular home-cooked dishes in Cantonese cuisine, best-loved for its easy preparation and alluring taste.This simple and delicate dish is one of my favorite weekday meals of all time and made with similar ingredients as the tomato egg stir fry, which is another household staple in Chinese cuisine. There’s nothing that beats a quick & easy stir-fry for busy days, and this dish brings together two of my favorite ingredients of eggs and shrimp.The harmony of these two is absolutely divine, as the flavors and textures complement beautifully when incorporated into one dish.The eggs are lightly folded and cooked into having a luscious, silky soft texture, and paired with savory shrimp that’s slightly crunchy on the outside, and juicy and tender on the inside.Best of all, this dish is incredibly quick and easy to prepare and calls for easily accessible ingredients that you most likely have in your kitchen at all times.Served over a plate of steamed rice and garnished with fresh scallions, these shrimp and eggs are truly the perfect meal that’s loaded with comfort and flavor.To make it even better, this shrimp and egg stir fry is incredibly nutritious and packed with protein, which makes it an ideal choice to incorporate into your weekly dinner rotation.What do I need to make Shrimp and Eggs?Similar to tomato eggs, this dish calls for simple ingredients that you most likely already have in your kitchen. Here are the ingredients you will need:Shrimp: peeled, deveined, and seasoned with salt, white (or black) pepper, sesame oil, and cornstarchEggs: beaten and seasoned with salt to elevate its flavorsGreen onion or scallions: for garnishVegetable oil (or any neutral cooking oil): for fryingAnd that’s it! With these simple ingredients as well as less than 10 minutes of time, you can easily whip up this delicious meal all in the comfort of your home.How do I make the best Shrimp and Egg Stir-Fry?This dish is one of my all-time favorites to make for busy days as it is delightfully easy to prepare and made in a single pan with minimum preparation.First, we peel, devein, and season the shrimp with salt, white pepper, sesame oil, and cornstarch, while beating and lightly seasoning the eggs with some salt and white parts of the green onion.Second, we heat up the oil in a wok or a frying pan on medium-high heat and cook the shrimp until they are opaque and pink, which should only take about a minute or two.The cooked shrimp is then to be added to the egg mixture, poured back into the same smoking hot wok (with some more oil), and gently folded until the eggs are cooked into a silky soft, slightly runny texture.To attain that perfect luscious texture, it’s important to keep the egg in one piece and not scramble too much.The key is to wait until the bottom is set, then lightly stir around and into the center of the egg in high heat until the eggs are just set and slightly runny.  Not to worry, the eggs will continue to cook with the residual heat and will result in that perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture that’s truly heavenly.Then you will immediately transfer the eggs onto a serving plate, to be garnished with green onions and extra sesame oil if desired.I personally like to serve this dish over some freshly steamed rice and kimchi as it is great as a meal of its own, but it’s truly a wonderful addition to any dinner table thanks to its versatile flavors. And that’s it! I hope you enjoy this delicious recipe as it is easily one of my favorite dishes of all time. Please leave me a comment below or message me on Instagram if you have any questions.

A hearty Vegetable Beef Soup with melt-in-your-mouth slow cooked chunks of beef, potato and vegetables simmered in a herb infused savoury broth. You’ll love how the broth of this beef soup recipe is slightly thickened so it’s like gravy and has extra flavour from a secret ingredient!

Vegetable Beef Soup
So many beef soups are watery and dull. Not this one!!! The thing that sets this beef soup recipe apart from the rest is the broth. It’s slightly thickened so it’s more like a thinnish gravy. It’s infused with herb flavour and also gets an extra depth of flavour from the secret ingredient: red wine. Or beer or stout. (They’re all good)
It’s not about boozing up our soup! It’s about adding complexity and character to the soup broth flavour without simmering for hours up hours like we do with Beef Stew and Pot Roast.
Without the wine, the broth still tastes very, very good.
With the wine, it’s stellar! (And in care you’re concerned, the alcohol gets cooked out, just leaving behind flavour.)
This Beef Soup is like beef stew in soup form – except faster to make!
What goes in Vegetable Beef Soup
Here’s what you need.

Stewing beef – anything economical, in small bite size pieces (remember, we’re making a soup here, not a stew)
Red wine, stout or guinness – all of these work great here. Red wine gives it a classic beef stew flavour, Guinness or stout will give the soup a more intense, deep flavour like Irish Guinness Stew. I use wine most frequently because I always have some on hand, and because I prefer not to just use part of a can of beer that I wouldn’t choose to drink!


How to make Beef Soup
The key step here is to brown the beef well – aggressively is the term that I use. This adds a ton of flavour to the beef itself and the broth, from the brown bits on the bottom of the pot that dissolves into the broth.
I like to sauté the mushrooms in butter and add them towards the end – but this is optional. Because golden brown buttery mushrooms vs mushrooms just simmered in the broth? There is no contest! (But really, it is optional 🙂 )



Fall-apart slow cooked beef!
I promised you fall-apart beef, and fall apart beef you shall get. And you will see just how tender the beef is in the recipe video below using the most ridiculous method – chopsticks of all things!! 
I know, I know, it’s soooo Asian.
But right at that moment while I was filming, it was the first thought that came to me as the easiest way to show it on camera! 😂 I mean, how else can I pry a piece of beef apart using one hand??

What Beef Soup goes with
There’s a ton of veggies in this soup, and you could add even more into the soup. Green beans would be ideal, but they were extortionately overpriced on the day I shot this and I just couldn’t do it.
So it’s an ideal meal-in-a bowl that doesn’t need anything more. But I’m pretty sure no one would say no to a side of quick Cheesy Garlic Bread!!! Or try one of these soup dunkers:

Recipe VIDEO above. Melt-in-your-mouth chunks of beef, vegetables and potato in a hearty herb infused broth. You'll love how the soup broth is slightly thickened and the extra flavour the wine or beer adds to the soup (the secret ingredient!). 20 minutes active cook/prep.
Ingredients▢ 1.5 tbsp olive oil , separated▢ 500g/1 lb  stewing beef , cut into 1.75cm / 2/3″ cubes (Note 1)▢ 1/2 tsp salt and pepper▢ 1 onion , chopped▢ 3 garlic , minced (1 tbsp)▢ 2 celery , cut into 0.8 cm / 1/3″ slices▢ 3 carrots , cut into 0.5 cm / 1/5″ thick slices (halve larger ones)▢ 4 tbsp flour▢ 2 1/2 cups (625ml)  beef broth/stock , low sodium▢ 1 1/2 cups (375ml)  dry red wine, Guinness beer or stout (Note 2)▢ 1.5 cups (375ml)  water▢ 2 tbsp tomato paste▢ 2 bay leaves▢ 1 tsp thyme dried▢ 1 cup frozen peas▢ 2 potatoes (any), cut into 1.5cm / 2/3″ cubesButtery mushrooms (optional):▢ 1 tbsp (15g)  butter or oil▢ 200g/ 6oz  small mushrooms , quartered or halved
InstructionsHeat 1 tbsp oil until very hot in a large, heavy based pot over high heat.Pat beef dry with paper towels, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.Brown beef aggressively in 2 or 3 batches, adding more oil if needed. Remove browned beef into a bowl.If pot looks dry, add a touch more oil.Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes.Add carrot and celery, cook for 2 minutes or until onion is translucent.Stir in flour, then slowly pour in beef broth while constantly stirring.Add beer, water, tomato paste, bay leaves and thyme, stir well. Then add the beef back in.Cover, adjust heat to medium low so it’s bubbling gently. Simmer 1 hr 15 min or until beef is pretty tender.Add potatoes and peas, simmer for a further 20 minutes without the lid. Add cooked mushrooms in the last 5 minutes.The soup is ready when the potatoes are cooked and beef is very tender (see video).Adjust salt and pepper to taste (I like lots of pepper in this!).Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with crusty bread if desired. Try quick Cheesy Garlic Bread or super easy Irish Soda Bread!Buttery Mushrooms (optional):Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until browned. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
 Recipe Notes:1. Beef – Use any stewing or braising beef, usually sold pre cut into small pieces ideal for this recipe. Otherwise, get a slow cooking cut like chuck or boneless short rib, then cut the beef into pieces. Look for beef that’s nicely marbled with fat for best results!
2. Red Wine, Guinness or Stout – will add incredible extra flavour into this soup broth! I use all 3, and enjoy them all. If you love Irish Beef Guinness Stew, you’ll know what the Guinness does to add flavour.

Red wine – any dry, full bodied red wine. Cab Sauv and Merlots are ideal.
Guinness Beer and Stout are dark beers, labelled as such on the cans. You should find these at most liquor stores. Use some, drink some – or tip the whole can in an simmer for longer with the lid off!
Non alcoholic sub – add 400g/14 oz can of crushed tomato, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce. This will add alternative flavour to compensate.

3. Storage – Like stew, it’s even better the next day! Will keep for 4 to 5 days in the fridge. Also freezes perfectly.
4. Nutrition per serving.

My favorite beef stew.  Only change I made was adding the peas just before serving and giving them a minute or two to warm.  Wish I’d doubled the recipe.

Great recipe. Thicken very nice. The wine was a bit too much. I was looking for more of a classic. But I will make again. With less wine possibly only 1/2 cup and use beef stock for the rest.

Cooked this twice, second time double the ingredients. Really tasty! Left out the peas and mushrooms though since not a fan.

I’ve made this 4 times and each time it’s so good.
 First I marinate the beef with a can of French onion soup.
And I add a can of beef consommé while cooking.  It’s so rich and delicious.
And don’t skip the beer or wine. I didn’t have the right beer one time, and though it was good, we could tell something was missing.

This recipe worked out great! I’m glad I could show my family in Germany what beef soup is all about. Of course I used a nice dark German beer and a bottle of half decent merlot. I made the recipe for 20 servings so we can eat for a few days. I am looking forward to these leftovers.

I enjoyed the soup – it is very flavourful!  However, most of the liquid boiled off so I ended up having to top it off with some more stock and water about 3 times in the hour.

Oh my goodness – this soup is SO flavorful and beautifully thick. I used bone broth for the stock, the wine only and added the mushrooms, it was so much goodness in a bowl. Went down a treat with some crusty sourdough. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This is the first time we didn’t care for a recipe -and we have tried many of Nagi’s (&Dozer’s) creations.
It was way too bland for our taste and rather on the sweet side.
I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes, frozen corn, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp dried parsley, and 1 tsp dried basil as well as some oregano and 2 beef cubes (plus more beef broth).

Not only did you alter it but you altered it with stuff that will absolutely sweeten any soup, like corn. ( think: corn syrup)
I think you should make it again and this time do it without the corn. I have a feeling it’s going to be a totally different experience for you.

Excellent recipe with wine substitute instead. Fun and simple. Time consuming unless you buy pre cut veggies but that’s to be expected. Any alcohol added to recipe is just overpowering so I just go with tomato paste etc and it’s perfect!

Everything I’ve learned living in Spain about how to make the best authentic, delicious, fresh tomato gazpacho recipe — in just 15 minutes!

Gazpacho Recipe
Fresh tomato season has finally returned again, which means that it’s time to start making allllll the gazpacho. ♡

I’ve been a fan of this refreshing, chilled, Spanish tomato soup for years. But ever since we moved to Barcelona, we have become next-level obsessed with it in the summertime, especially after having had the chance to spend time in Andalucía, the region where gazpacho originated. Down in that part of the country, gazpacho is available just about everywhere you turn — from restaurants, to bars, to coffee shops, to every little supermercado that you pass by. Even here in Barcelona, our nearest grocery store offers no less than seven different types of grab-and-go bottled gazpacho! It’s everyone’s favorite light and refreshing meal here to beat the summertime heat. And when made with the season’s best ripe produce — oh boy — there’s nothing better.

That said, if you have the chance to visit Spain, you will find that gazpacho here varies slightly from region to region. And of course, there are a million non-traditional ingredients and twists that modern cooks love to try too. But that said, Andaluz-style tomato gazpacho is probably the version that comes to mind when most people think of this blended soup. So if you happen to be craving a bowl (or a glass with a straw, see below!), here is my go-to gazpacho recipe that I absolutely love. It’s quick and easy to make in just 15 minutes or so, and I consider it lo mejor — just the best!


THE BEST GAZPACHO RECIPE | 1-MINUTE VIDEO
Tomato Gazpacho Ingredients In Blender
SPANISH GAZPACHO INGREDIENTS:
Gazpacho is the quintessential summer soup because all of the fresh ingredients are deliciously in season this time of year, and there’s no need to heat up your stove or oven! Just prep your ingredients on a cutting board. Then your blender or food processor will take it from there. To make this homemade gazpacho recipe, you will need:

Tomatoes: Roma tomatoes or what we call “branch tomatoes” here in Spain (medium, round, soft-skinned tomatoes on the vine) are standard for traditional gazpacho. But really, any ripe, juicy, fresh tomatoes will do. There is no need to peel your tomatoes for gazpacho, but I do recommend coring them (scoop out the white flesh and seeds).
Cucumber: 6-inch Persian or Kirby cucumbers are most often used in Spain, peeled and seeded. But I usually just toss in half of an English cucumber instead. Whichever works for you!
Green bell pepper: Some of my Spanish friends are firm believers that green bell peppers, specifically, are a must for authentic Spanish gazpacho. But I’d say that any color of bell pepper you have on hand will do. :)
Bread: Leftover white bread is the key to the texture of authentic gazpacho, helping to thicken it slightly and round out the flavors. Our friends here taught us to discard the crusts for optimal texture. Then to help the bread blend well, you can either:
blend up the gazpacho, then poke the slice of bread into the center of the soup and let it sit there for 10 minutes to soften before blending it into the soup, or…
just run it under the faucet and soak completely with water, ring it out completely with your hands, then add the bread to the soup ingredients and puree
Red onion: Just half of a small red onion, peeled.
Garlic: I use two small garlic cloves, or one large clove.
Olive oil: Many traditional gazpacho recipes are loaded with lots of olive oil. But nowadays in Spain, they often cut down the amount of oil to make the soup a bit healthier. This recipe just uses 3 tablespoons.
Sherry vinegar: Andalucía is known for its sherry. And of course, it’s sherry vinegar (vinagre de Jerez), which is always used to make gazpacho here in Spain. That said, though, if you can’t find sherry vinegar at your grocery store, you can sub in some red wine vinegar.
Ground cumin: One of our friends in Andalucía taught me the secret of adding cumin to your gazpacho, which is actually a popular ingredient in the south of Spain due to the region’s proximity to Morocco. I love the subtle, earthy note that it adds to this recipe.
Sea salt and black pepper: Essentials!
Pureed Tomato Gazpacho In Blender
HOW TO MAKE GAZPACHO:
To make homemade gazpacho soup, simply:

Puree the soup: Combine all of your gazpacho ingredients in a blender or food processor, and puree for 1 minute or until the gazpacho reaches your desired consistency. (I love mine super-smooth.)
Chill: Transfer the soup to a sealed container and refrigerate for 4 hours or until completely chilled.
Serve: Then serve the soup nice and cold, garnished with your favorite toppings.
Gazpacho In A Jar
GAZPACHO SOUP TOPPINGS:
With such a simple pureed soup, toppings are a must in my book! I like to add any combination of the following to gazpacho:

Homemade croutons: Easy to make with any leftover bread that you happen to have on hand.
Fresh herbs: Basil, thyme, oregano, rosemary and/or chives are some of our faves.
Fresh-cracked black pepper: Always a must, in my book.
Olive oil: An extra drizzle on top is traditional in Spain.
Cream: A drizzle of cream (or sour cream) can be nice, if you would like a creamier soup.
Spanish ham and chopped hard-boiled eggs: These toppings are traditional with salmorejo, but they are also popular with gazpacho in the south of Spain.
Or, of course, it’s probably most common to just sprinkle a few of the leftover chopped gazpacho veggies on top (such as tomato, green pepper, onion or cucumber). Whatever sounds good to you!

HOW TO SERVE GAZPACHO:
You can either serve gazpacho soup in a bowl or mug, garnished with your desired toppings. Or to keep things super simple, many places in Spain just serve gazpacho over ice in glasses with a straw, which I really love! (See photos below.)

The one thing to note when serving gazpacho is that it needs to be thoroughly chilled. So plan to blend up the recipe a few hours before serving, so that it has ample time to cool off in the fridge before your meal.

POSSIBLE VARIATIONS:
While the recipe below is for authentic tomato gazpacho, there are of course zillions of ways that you could customize your gazpacho. You could:

Add fruit: Watermelon, cantaloupe, and strawberries are the common additions to red gazpacho here in Spain. (Here is my recipe for watermelon gazpacho.)
Add veggies: Beets, zucchini and corn are also popular additions.
Add extra herbs: Feel free to also add in any fresh herbs that sound good, such as basil, rosemary, thyme, or chives.
Add spice: This is definitely not a common addition to gazpacho in Spain, since the country almost always avoids heat in its food. But I sometimes love adding in a few slices of jalapeño or serrano to this recipe to give it an extra kick.

NOTES
Tomatoes: To core the tomatoes, simply scoop out and discard the seeds, plus any of the tough white cores.

Cucumber: Or you can just add in half of an English cucumber, which does not need to be seeded.

Bread: We typically just use a baguette.  To soak your bread, I recommend simply running it under the sink for few seconds to soak it with water.  Then ring our the extra water and add the bread to the blender or food processor.

Storage instructions: Leftover soup can be transferred to a food storage container and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

This is great. I used a little more cumin because I love it. I also like my gazpacho a little more “chunky “ so did not puree it until completely smooth. Also subbed red bell pepper for the green, as green pepper seems not to like me (burp) 🙄

Used canned tomatoes as tomatoes are really not in season. Added my own homemade bread, red pepper, large garlic clove, lots more cumin and chile pepper. Will garnish with scallions or chives from the garden, parsley and basil with chunks of english cuke and green or red pepper. Some might like to run this through a sieve for a smoother soup.

ROB — JULY 15, 2023 @ 6:13 PM REPLY
Absolutely delicious! I have been making gazpacho for many years and this was the by far the best. I did not use a green pepper. Instead I used some red and orange peppers. I also added a jalapeño for a little kick. I also added 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Sherry vinegar is a must. For the first time I used the soaked bread. I have always shied away from using the bread but the difference it made was Iremarkable. It has an added smoothness. I did add a bit of cumin. There was just a hint of the flavor that definitely uplifted the soup.
I did not make the croutons as I like to make a “relish” to go on top. Today it was 1/2 lb garlic sautéed shrimp that I cut into small pieces, 1 ear of grilled corn, 1 jalapeños, couple tbsp of minced red onion, cilantro, some lime juice, olive oil, tad of cumin,cayenne and salt and pepper.

Great recipe! I did deviate a bit and added roasted sesame oil with the olive oil. Came out great but probably not so authentic now.

A deli and diner classic, this mile-high sandwich is all too easy to make at home once you get your hands on all the ingredients. In 10 minutes, you’ll have a wow-worthy, towering lunch on your hands that we guarantee will make your week. Read on for everything you need to know to make this layered lunch staple: What makes a club sandwich?This classic sandwich is comprised of 3 types of meat (ham, turkey, and bacon), lettuce, tomato, and cheddar, all layered between 3 slices of toasted bread. While the stacking may seem tedious, trust us—it’s what makes this sandwich absolutely packed with flavor. The order of stacking is important and traditional, so stick with it if you’re looking to make the classic club! The bread. Because bread is one of our star players in this recipe, we recommend being intentional with your choice. Use a good, fresh, sliced variety (homemade sourdough is hard to beat), and toast it just enough so that the butter melts in as you spread it on. Toasting also helps with the sandwich’s structural integrity, and buttering helps add a bit of richness to our layers of flavor. Variations.If you want to buck tradition, you can swap in some ingredients to spice up this classic sandwich. One of our favorite swaps? Change out the deli ham for the slightly more flavorful (and beautiful) mortadella. If you want things a bit lighter, you can swap the bacon for turkey bacon, or even use some veggie bacon!Made this classic sandwich?

This Chinese-inspired fried rice recipe is my absolute fave. It’s quick and easy to make, customizable with any of your favorite mix-ins, and so irresistibly delicious.

The BEST Fried Rice Recipe from Gimme Some Oven
Hey friends! I’m digging back into the blog archives today to share one of my all-time favorite recipes.

My favorite homemade fried rice. ♡

Growing up, our family had a tradition of eating lunch every Saturday at our neighborhood’s favorite local Chinese restaurant. And every single Saturday for lunch, I ordered the same thing — egg drop soup and fried rice, my absolute favorites. This restaurant set the bar high for me early when it comes to how amazing fried rice could be. Theirs was always perfectly al dente with slightly crispy edges, full of rich savory flavors, and loaded up with plenty of extra veggies, eggs, and whatever protein sounded good.

After our favorite restaurant sadly closed over a decade ago, I spent years tinkering around with dozens and dozens of batches of fried rice, attempting to recreate a fried recipe that tasted as good as theirs. And while nothing will ever match the original in my book, this fried rice recipe that I’ve landed on is as close as I’ve come and has been my favorite go-to ever since. It’s surprisingly speedy to make, easy to customize with your favorite add-ins, and SO flavorful and comforting. Thousands of our readers have also made and enjoyed it over the years since. So if you’re looking for a good recipe to try, I hope you’ll enjoy it too.

Let’s make some homemade fried rice!


FRIED RICE RECIPE | 1-MINUTE VIDEO
TIPS FOR MAKING THE BEST FRIED RICE:
Ok, let’s get right to it. Here are the important things I have learned over the years about how to make the best fried rice.

1) Use cold rice: You’ve gotta plan ahead and use thoroughly-chilled cooked rice. A fresh batch of warm (or even lukewarm) rice will not fry well when it hits the hot pan, and will result in soggy and sticky clumps — no good. So leftover refrigerated rice is ideal! Or, if you are in a hurry (or have an impulse craving for fried rice, which I completely understand ?), just cook up a fresh batch of rice. Then spread it out on a baking sheet or another large flat pan, drape the rice with a layer of plastic wrap, then pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes (or in the freezer for 10-15 minutes) until it is thoroughly chilled (not frozen).

2) Use butter: Yes, butter. I have made many a batch of fried rice using various oils, and I’m now convinced there’s a reason why Japanese steak houses use that big slab of butter when they’re making fried rice. It just tastes so much better, and also makes everything brown up perfectly. (Although by contrast to Japanese steak houses, we only use 3 tablespoons for a large batch of rice in this recipe.)

3) Use veggies: This is one of my big pet peeves with lame take-out fried rice — not enough veggies! In addition to adding some nice spots of color, veggies go a long way in adding some flavor and freshness to fried rice. Our local Chinese restaurant always added both white and green onions, too, which I included in this recipe. But feel free to modernize this recipe with some other delicious stir-fried veggies as well!

4)  Use toasted sesame oil and oyster sauce: If you do not eat seafood, you can leave out the oyster sauce and your fried rice will still be great. But this ingredient makes such a difference in good fried rice, and a little goes a long way. So even if you’re not into oysters, don’t be scared of oyster sauce! Toasted sesame oil, on the other hand, is 100% non-negotiable. It is my favorite smelling ingredient in my kitchen, and tastes wonderful in fried rice. (Also note that sesame oil is meant as a finishing oil, not a cooking oil, so remove the pan from the heat and then stir it in.)

5) Use high heat: This will help fry and brown the rice and veggies well, and will also help prevent the rice from steaming in the pan instead of frying.

6) Let the rice brown a bit on the bottom: If you’re like me and love your rice to be a bit crispy, let it rest for a bit in between stirs so that it can brown a bit on the bottom. It also helps greatly to use a non-stick skillet so that the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.

7) Don’t be afraid to add in some extra soy sauce at the end: I know that everyone has different sensitivities to salt, and different brands of soy sauce also contain pretty dramatically different levels of sodium. So I went a little light on soy sauce in the recipe below. But please add more at the end if this tastes good to you. I almost always stir an extra drizzle into my portion and love it.

Homemade Fried Rice Recipe
HOMEMADE FRIED RICE INGREDIENTS:
Alright, so let’s talk ingredients. To make this fried rice recipe, you will need (affiliate links included):

Cooked, chilled rice: Any kind of white or brown rice will do. Just be sure that it is cooked (I always cook mine in this rice cooker, which works like a charm) and thoroughly chilled (in a sealed container in the refrigerator) before adding it to your hot skillet. Again, freshly-cooked rice will not work well in this recipe.
Eggs: Which add great flavor, texture and protein.
Carrots, onions, green onions and peas: This is the base mix of veggies that I always use for fried rice, but feel free to add in other stir-fry veggies you love (see ideas below).
Garlic: Freshly-minced.
Soy sauce: I created this recipe using low-sodium soy sauce. So add less if you’re using traditional soy sauce.
Oyster sauce: This is a major flavor booster in fried rice and (don’t worry) doesn’t taste like oysters. You can find it in the Asian section of grocery stores, or order it on Amazon. 
Toasted sesame oil: The finishing touch in this recipe, which is a must. You can also find it in the Asian section of grocery stores, or order it on Amazon.
Butter: My favorite way to stir fry rice.

How To Make Stir Fried Rice
HOW TO MAKE FRIED RICE:
To make this homemade fried rice recipe, simply:

Scramble eggs: Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them into small pieces as you go. Then transfer the eggs to a separate plate, and set aside.
Sauté veggies and garlic: Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.
Stir fry rice: Then turn the burner to high heat. Scooch the veggies over to one side of the pan, melt the remaining butter in the other half, and add the chilled rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using). Then stir to combine with the veggies and continue sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3 minutes, or until you notice the rice and veggies starting to brown slightly.
Remove pan from heat. And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled eggs.
Taste and season. Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, plus any extra soy sauce or sesame oil if needed.
Serve! Then dish it up and serve nice and warm!

EASY FRIED RICE VARIATIONS:
The sky’s the limit when it comes to homemade fried rice variations, so feel free to get creative and use up other leftover ingredients you may happen to have on hand. That said, here are some classic add-ins:

Chicken Fried Rice: You can either sauté some chicken in a separate sauté pan while making your fried rice. Then shred or dice and add to your fried rice. Or for a shortcut, I like to shred a rotisserie chicken. Or even better, shred leftovers from my favorite baked chicken breasts recipe.
Pork Fried Rice: Sauté a boneless pork chop in a separate sauté pan while making your fried rice. Then dice and add to your rice.
Beef Fried Rice: Sauté steak or brown ground beef in a separate sauté pan while making your fried rice. Then crumble or dice and add to your rice.
Shrimp Fried Rice: Sauté half a pound of peeled, raw shrimp in separate sauté pan while making your fried rice. Then add the shrimp to your rice.
Vegetable Fried Rice: Any stir-fry friendly veggies would be great in fried rice! Just sauté at the same time that you cook the onions, carrots, peas and garlic. Then stir to combine with the fried rice.
Kimchi Fried Rice: Fresh kimchi adds a major flavor boost to fried rice. Just chop and stir it in to make kimchi fried rice.
Pineapple Fried Rice: Fresh pineapple can be traditional in Chinese or Thai fried rice. Just chop and stir it in to combine.
Also, in lieu of using traditional white rice in this recipe, feel free to make:

Fried Brown Rice: For a healthier twist, feel free to use cooked brown rice in this recipe instead of white rice.
Quinoa Fried Rice: Here is my favorite recipe.

1 small white onion, diced
1/2 cup frozen peas
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and black pepper

Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark
INSTRUCTIONS
Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a large sauté pan* over medium-high heat until melted. Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally. Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.
Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat until melted. Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for about 5 minutes or until the onion and carrots are soft. Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, and stir until melted. Immediately add the rice, green onions, soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using), and stir until combined. Continue sautéing for an additional 3 minutes to fry the rice, stirring occasionally.  (I like to let the rice rest for a bit between stirs so that it can crisp up on the bottom.)  Then add in the eggs and stir to combine. Remove from heat, and stir in the sesame oil until combined.  Taste and season with extra soy sauce, if needed.
Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days.

NOTES
*Sauté pan: If you happen to own a nonstick or cast-iron pan, I would recommend it for this recipe.  But that said, any pan that you have can work — you may just have to be a bit more vigilant with stirring so that the rice and eggs don’t stick.

The best recipe hands down for fried rice. Even with the simplest ingredients it comes out wonderful. My go to.

LOGAN M. — AUGUST 30, 2023 @ 11:44 AM REPLY
Very good, the sauce was salty when I initially mixed it before adding it into the rice so I added a little bit of sugar and some honey and it turned out great. The leftovers didn’t last long either

I just made this tonight with leftover take out Chinese rice and all 4 of my kids LOVED it! It is very rare for me to find a recipe that all of my kids like, but this is one of them. They even asked if I could make it again tomorrow. I’m printing off this recipe and adding it to my cookbook. Thanks so much for this amazing recipe!!

Made this tonight and added leftover pork tenderloin. Used some leftover rice mix from the freezer and enough brown rice to get to 4 cups. Added extra soy and sliced green onion. We both loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe! I made it with riced cauliflower instead of regular rice and it was excellent. I also added a diced boneless sparerib and a 1/2 tsp of fresh minced ginger. I will definitely make this again. I can’t eat rice because of all the carbs so this is a great alternative. I am also gluten free and just used gf soy sauce.

I absolutely LOVE fried rice. I moved recently to Tennessee and there is nowhere that makes even a half decent fried rice. So I tried your recipe and I absolutely love it!! So easy and delicious. My family also loves it and that’s a plus. All I did differently was add shrimp. My favorite kind of fried rice! Thanks for the recipe. It’s going in the rotation now!!

I absolutely love shrimp fried rice! I have no restaurants near me anymore that do an even halfway job of it. Found your recipe and love it!! Added the shrimp and mwah, chefs kiss!! It was great.

NANCY D. — OCTOBER 4, 2023 @ 6:11 PM REPLY
Using butter produces superior results. Stove top non stick skillet so much easier than using a wok. The results surpassed what I have had at restaurants. Easy, fast with amazing flavor and consistency! Great recipe!

The high heat for our stovetops must be different. I cooked to directions, burnt quite a bit before the timers went off.

Be careful, folks!

NIKKI D — OCTOBER 20, 2023 @ 12:04 PM REPLY
I’ve been on a fried rice kick lately and have been scouring the internet for different variations. Did this [almost] to a t , but added a little 5 spice powder, diced chicken (so my husband would eat it as an actual “meal” lol) and also hit the veggies and then the rice with a torch (easy way to achieve at home “wok hei”) and it was was SO good :)

CINDY — OCTOBER 26, 2023 @ 10:30 PM REPLY
I made it just like your recipe said, I just didn’t have oyster sauce, but I do love Kikkoman low salt soy sauce, has a much more malty flavor. I made it with pork tenderloin sliced thin, dipped in flour I was out of cornstarch. Fried them very quickly and with the scrambled eggs and mixed vegetables it was wonderful. Rice was crunchy, I used butter like you said. WOW!

I’ve made this several times and my family loves it! I settled on a few additions. I used 1.5x the soy and oyster sauces. I also added 2 teaspoons of fish sauce to the soy and oyster sauces. I also added 1 heaping tablespoon of white miso paste to the veggies. So good! Thanks for the recipe!

Okay, so because I didn’t plan ahead by reading the recipe in advance, I didn’t use super cold/next day rice. I made it THEN went to the recipe and panicked. BUTTTTTTTT- it worked out great using just made rice! I threw the rice onto a cookie sheet after it was done and put it in the freezer for like 30 minutes while I prepped everything and set the table, and answered at least sixty-three “whatcha doin'” questions (ha!).

I imagine it could’ve been better as written but in a pinch, I did what I had to do after promising my kids they’d have delicious fried rice for lunch!
Thanks for the great recipe. It was easy and super delicious.

I am still getting the gist of cooking it all up fast enough but the flavor is delicious! I’ve made this a few times already for hubby and myself adding different veggies/meats. I love love love adding mushrooms. Hubby loves adding pineapple, pork and bell peppers. Anything goes with this recipe. Each time, the dish gets better/easier/faster. Five stars. Thanks for sharing. 😊

Ingredients

olive oil
1 red onion
1 red pepper
1 yellow pepper

1 handful of frozen peas
2 large ripe tomatoes

TAP FOR INGREDIENTS
Method
Wash 150g of potatoes and chop into 1cm dice, then put into a 25cm non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and a good splash of water and toss well.
Peel 1 red onion, deseed 1 red and 1 yellow pepper, chop both into 1cm dice as well, then toss into the pan. Cook gently for 15 minutes on a medium-low heat, or until softened and lightly golden, adding splashes of water if needed, and tossing regularly.
Meanwhile, beat 4 eggs with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper for 2 minutes so they’re light and fluffy.
Toss 1 handful of frozen peas into the pan, then pour in the egg mixture. Use a rubber spatula to thoroughly mix it all together and begin to cook the eggs, then push it out flat, cover with a lid and leave to cook through for 5 minutes, or until set on the top and golden on the bottom.
While that cooks, halve 2 large ripe tomatoes and remove the cores, deseed ½–1 chilli (to your taste), place both in a blender with half the juice from 1 lemon and blitz until smooth, then taste and season to perfection.
Loosen around the edge of the omelette with the spatula, then place a large plate or board over the pan and in one bold, careful movement, flip it over onto the plate or board.
Dress 2 handfuls of rocket with the remaining lemon juice, pile in the centre, and finely grate over 15g of Parmesan. Serve the omelette warm with the salsa, and a shake of Tabasco chipotle sauce is nice too.

Congee with Soft Boiled Egg 

I’ve waxed poetic a ton about my love of congee before. It doesn’t matter if it’s Taiwanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, or Singaporean — I’m always game for a comforting bowl of rice porridge adorned with all kinds of salty-spicy-sour-herby toppings. This version, one of my favorites, is Thai and is adapted from Kris Yenbamroong’s Night + Market.

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups uncooked jasmine rice
3 chicken bouillon cubes
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
4 eggs
1/4 cup minced garlic
Vegetable oil
2 inches ginger, peeled and cut into short matchsticks
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1/2 cup sliced green onions
Fish sauce
Pepper
Chile oil
1. Make the fried garlic: Pour 1 inch of oil into a saucepan. Heat the oil over medium-low. Add the garlic and fry until golden and crispy, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir occasionally, especially towards the end of cooking when the garlic has taken on a golden color. Remove the garlic using a slotted spoon and cool on a paper towel-lined plate. 
2. In a large pot, bring 3 1/2 quarts water to a boil. Add the rice, bouillon cubes, and salt and simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the grains have mostly dissolved and the rice has broken down into a porridge, about 1 1/2 hours. 
3. Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of water to boil over high heat. Boil the eggs for 5 to 6 minutes and remove from the pot. Cool eggs slightly and peel. 
4. Once the congee is done, divide it onto serving bowls and garnish each with a soft-boiled egg, fried garlic, ginger, cilantro, green onions, and fish sauce, pepper, and chile oil to taste.

Method


Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Put the tomatoes in a small roasting tin and cook for 15 minutes, or until softened and just starting to split.
Meanwhile, fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil; add the vinegar. Cut the avocados in half and scoop out the flesh into a bowl (discard the stone). Add half the lime juice, the pepper sauce and some salt. Using the back of a spoon, roughly smash the avocado, until chunky but spreadable.
Preheat the grill to its highest setting or set a griddle pan on the hob over a medium-high heat. Brush the sourdough slices with the oil on both sides and toast for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until lightly charred.
Poach the eggs in the pan of boiling water for 2-3 minutes, until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny*. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
Spread the sourdough toasts with the smashed avocado and divide between two plates, along with the roasted tomatoes and some salad. Top each with a poached egg and season with some freshly cracked black pepper. Serve with a drizzle of hot pepper sauce, if you like.

Tip: For a great flavour combo, rustle up a roasted red pepper, feta and rocket side salad.

*If serving vulnerable groups, elderly people, toddlers, pregnant women and people who are unwell, cook eggs until the whites and yolks are solid.

SHOW MORE NOTES
Notes
Placing the lid on and taking it off in these recipe instructions is really important so you have the right amount of liquid in the pan by the end of the recipe.
We used grape tomatoes because they are sweet but you could also use cherry tomatoes or even chopped tomatoes.
We used rigatoni, but you can choose any pasta you prefer.
The mozzarella cubes may be replaced with shredded mozzarella.
Don't forget to add that balsamic vinegar at the end of the recipe. It gives the flavours a nice balance.

I like my breakfast simple. A few ingredients, filling, hearty, and delicious. These Crispy One Pan Potatoes with Eggs fit the bill nicely. They also happen to be easy on the wallet and budget friendly!

How to Make Crispy One Pan Potatoes:
Let’s start with the taters! I like to use new rose potatoes in the recipe, basically because I am lazy and there is no peeling required. But also because they taste amazing. I cook them in butter or ghee until the edges are brown and crispy…

…then I make wells with the back of a spoon and crack the eggs right into the wells, cover with a lid and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are runny. This breakfast is to die for!

The Recipe: Crispy One Pan Potatoes with Eggs
What you will need: I prefer using a cast iron pan to make potatoes really crispy. I love Maldon Sea Salt and buy the tub to save money. This recipe is grain, gluten and those with dairy intolerances or who are on Whole 30 can use ghee instead of butter.

This is sucha  great all-in-one breakfast! Love anything made in a skillet. One quick question though – you said it can be made dairy free if you use ghee, but ghee is made from butter, so does that make it dairy free? Just trying to find out if there is something I dont know about as I dont follow a dairy free diet!
Reply 






 

Linda Spiker 
					on July 18, 2016 at 12:53 pm				



Ghee is made from butter but all the milk solids are removed so essentially it’s pure fat with no lactose, cassein or other “dairy” properties. People that are on dairy free diets can usually still consume ghee with no ill effects 🙂

Strictly for aesthetic reasons. I tried it both ways and three eggs looked better than four for photographic purposes (more potatoes could show with three eggs). Of course you can use as many or as few as you wish 🙂

I have made something similar several times and find it faster to cook the potatoes in the microwave until a bit soft. The overall preparation is quite a bit faster. For dinner I usually add some red or yellow peppers. Delicious!

Hi Keith, You can see them in the photo. They are a small young potato with a rose colored skin. They come white as well. Very common. I bet you have seen them but never knew they were call rose potatoes:)

Ghee is prepared by simmering butter, which is churned from cream, and removing the liquid residue.[1] Spices can be added for flavor.[2] The texture, colour, and taste of ghee depend on the quality of the butter, source of the milk used in the process and the duration of the boiling.   
Ghee IS a dairy product.

Linda Spiker

Ghee is made from butter which yes is a dairy product. But because all milk solids are removed and only the fat is left those with dairy intolerances can still eat it. It is the milk solids and not the fat that cause a problem.

Lay the final slice of bread, hummus side down, then press down and eat as is or cut the sandwich into quarters.Recipe from Good Food magazine, June 2006AdvertisementComments, questions and tipsRate this recipeWhat is your star rating out of 5?1 star out of 52 stars out of 53 stars out of 54 stars out of 55 stars out of 5Choose the type of message you'd like to postChoose the type of message you'd like to postCommentQuestionTipOverall ratingA star rating of 4.8 out of 5.31 ratingsAdvertisementAdvertisementChristmas Subscription OfferJoin our subscriber club and choose a new cookbook from Jamie, Nadiya or Mary Berry.Order nowAdvertisementSubscribe and choose a new cookbookThe perfect Christmas gift for you or a loved oneOrder nowOur mobile appSearch, save and sort your favourite recipes and view them offline.Get the appWine ClubJoin the BBC Good Food Wine ClubOrder your first caseVisit us on FacebookVisit us on TwitterVisit us on InstagramVisit us on PinterestVisit us on YoutubeVisit us on RssAbout usContact UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsCookies PolicyComplaints escalationAdvertiseContact BBC StudiosManage Privacy Settingsnull LogoThis website is published by Immediate Media Company Limited under licence from BBC Studios Distribution.© Immediate Media Company Ltd. 2023Nutracheck.co.ukOliveMagazine.comRadioTimes.comHistoryExtra.comGardenersWorld.comMadeForMums.comTheRecommended.comBarbecueDietary needsHealthy eatingSeasonalBread, pastry & cakesDinner ideasNuts & seedsSoupsBreakfastDinner partyPoultrySpecial occasionsCasserole & slow cookerDrinksPulses & grainsSweet treatsCheeseEasterQuick & easy budget mealsVeganChristmasFamily friendlyRed meat & gameVegetablesCuisineFish & seafoodReligious eventsVegetarianDessertsFruitSalads"

Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.Snip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.For the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.For the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.For the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.For 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.For the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.Once all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.Recipe TipsFor the best English breakfast, always buy sausages with a high meat content. For the bacon, choose between back or streaky, smoked or unsmoked bacon; generally, dry-cure has the best flavour.ChristmasRecipes Related RecipesShakshukaBy The Hairy BikersSee more Big breakfasts recipes (24)Baked eggs three ways By Sarah CookSee more cooked breakfast recipes (35)Follow BBC FoodLike BBC FoodFollow BBC FoodFAQs about BBC FoodFind us here

Authentic Migas Breakfast Recipe
I’m so excited to share this recipe with you today. It’s one of the first breakfasts I learnt to make as a child. I literally was 9 years old when I started making them! Although I did not add all of the yummy veggies back then, it was still delicious! More about that on the variations section below 🙂

Migas are very popular breakfast in Mexico and even in the United States. But let me tell you that I didn’t grow up calling them Migas….apparently, in my home town of Ciudad Obregon, we call them Sopitas Con Huevos! But recently I learned that no one else calls them that. Who would’ve thunk it!

Other names This recipe also goes by Huevo Con Tortilla, Tortillas Con Huevo, Sopitas Con Huevo, and probably more names! It’s inexpensive, paleo-friendly, gluten free, vegetarian and great for lunch or dinner, too.

*** Make sure to read the entire blog post. Every step matters since I provide helpful tips along the way!

Ingredients
This recipe is for my authentic Mexican Migas Con Huevos. I don’t add any fancy ingredients, so they’re easy to whip up on regular weekday mornings. I keep the oil low for health reasons but the tortillas still turn out crispy, and all around delicious. I love them, and I think you will too.

The Oil – You can use vegetable, grapeseed, or avocado oil
Corn tortillas – If you have old corn tortillas the better. Also use the thinner kind as they won’t soak too much oil like the thick ones too. You can cut them with a knife or use your hands like a normally do 🙂 If you have the time, you can bake the tortillas in order to use less oil if you prefer.
Onion – I use yellow or white onion. Whatever you have at hand will work.
Jalapeño – if you like to eat spicy food, you may also add a serrano pepper. Make sure to remove the seeds. Another option is the use of bell pepper for a mild version.
Roma tomato – you can use roma or any other kind you have at hand.
4 large eggs
Kosher salt and pepper for seasoning.
Shredded cheese: this ingredient is optional. Use a good melting cheese like queso oaxaca, mozzarella or monterey jack cheese.
+ Your favorite toppings such as: Salsa Mexicana, avocados, and even Mexican crema.

How To Make Migas Breakfast
It takes about 20 minutes total to throw together and everything is made in one skillet.

Frying corn tortillas squares on a skillet.
In a medium nonstick frying pan, heat oil on an over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the corn tortillas and fry just until crisp, about 2 minutes.
A white skillet sautéing corn tortillas.
Once they’re all crispy, remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, and set aside.
A white skillet sauteing onions and chopped jalapeños.
In same frying pan, add the onion and jalapeño. Cook on medium-high heat until they start to soften up. About 1 minute.
A white skillet sautéing onions, chopped jalapeños and tomatoes.
Add the tomato and cook for another minute. Season the veggies with a pinch of salt and black pepper.
Four eggs on a white bowl.
While the veggies are cooking, add the eggs to a bowl, season with salt, pepper and add water.
Scrambled eggs on a white plate.
Whisk with a fork until smooth.

Lower the heat to medium, add crispy tortillas back in the pan and the egg mixture, and let sit for about 30 seconds or until it starts to set on the bottom.

Gently stir to mix the eggs with the tortillas and veggies. Cook eggs until set or they reach your desired consistency.

Serve immediately, add salsa, hot sauce and any other desired toppings.

Variations
Make plain Migas – Just the tortillas and eggs should be enough for a delicious and easy breakfast. This is how I usually eat them during the week and want everything ready in less than 5 minutes.
Add more protein – You can add fried ham, chorizo or bacon.
Change the type of pepper – Instead of jalapeños you can use anaheim pepper or roasted poblano peppers.
Serving Suggestions
Migas taste amazing on their own but sometimes you want to pair them with something else. My go to pairing is refried beans and Mexican hot chocolate on the side.

What kind of skillet should I use?
I like to use a non stick skillet since it requires less oil to prevent sticking, which leads to healthier cooking. I also like a cast iron skillet it’s basically nonstick once it has a nice sheen to it. That means you can cook with less oil too!

FAQ
What is the difference between Migas and Chilaquiles?
The difference is that for the Chilaquiles, the fried tortillas are covered in either red or green sauce and topped with an egg (optional). The tortillas in Migas do not have any sauce and the eggs are scrambled and mixed with the tortillas. This renders two different distinct flavors.

Why are migas called Migas?
Migas comes from the word “migajas” in Spanish which translates to “crumbs” in English. The migas part represent the dish made out of leftovers consisting of corn tortillas, whatever vegetables you have at hand mixed with eggs.

Where are Migas from?
It is known that this dish originated in Spain but there is also a Portuguese version. The European dish is made with bread instead of tortillas as known in Mexico and the vegetables varies according to taste.

Not sure what to make for breakfast today? These Easy Breakfast Quesadillas are filled with fluffy scrambled eggs, green peppers, bacon and cheddar cheeses, all enveloped between two crispy tortilla shells. It’s an easy meal that’s perfect for busy mornings!

These Easy Breakfast Quesadillas are filled with fluffy, scrambled eggs, green peppers, bacon and cheddar cheeses, all enveloped between two crispy tortilla shells. It’s an easy meal that’s perfect for busy mornings!
Since egg breakfast ideas are the name of my game, you can be sure that this breakfast quesadilla recipe is a winner!
Truth be told, I’ve been wanting to make these breakfast quesadillas for a long time. I’ve had this idea for months, and while this is not a new and creative recipe, it’s one that I truly love. 
Eggs, bacon, and cheese all wrapped up in a convenient, grab ‘n go breakfast for busy mornings? Perfection, right there! I’m always looking for ways to make my breakfasts just a little bit easier and a whole lot tastier, so these quesadillas definitely did the trick.
And like most of my recipes, this breakfast quesadilla recipe with eggs and bacon are a breeze to whip up! 
From start to finish, you can have this prepped, cooked and ready to be devoured in less than 20 minutes. How about that for a weekday breakfast or weeknight dinner?

Ingredients in Breakfast Quesadillas 
This is one of my all-time favorite egg recipes for breakfast! To make the quesadillas, all you need are: 

Eggs
Milk
Green pepper
Unsalted butter
Bacon 
Shredded cheddar cheese
Tortillas 

How to Make a Breakfast Quesadilla
Breakfast quesadillas are oozing with flavor and are perfect for keeping you full all morning long. The fluffy eggs, crisp bacon, green peppers, and melty cheese create an irresistible combo when wrapped in a tortilla shell.
Here’s an overview of how this quick and easy recipe is made: 

First you’ll start by whisking the eggs and milk together.
Add in the green pepper and then stir to combine.
Add butter to a heated skillet and cook the eggs until soft.
Place one tortilla onto the same skillet, top with shredded cheese, followed by the eggs, bacon, and more cheese.
Place the second tortilla on top of the egg mixture and lightly press down to seal. Heat for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until cheese is melted.


Can I Make These Vegetarian? 
Absolutely! Omit the bacon and use your favorite type of bean instead. 
Can I Freeze Breakfast Quesadillas?
Yes! Here’s how to freeze breakfast quesadillas for later: 

Assemble the quesadillas, then let them cool completely.
Once cooled, place them on a parchment paper-lined baking tray and freeze until hard (about 1 to 2 hours).
Transfer the hardered quesadillas to a freezer bag and freeze up to 3 months.
When ready to eat, warm (from frozen) in the oven or a toaster oven at 350F until heated through. 

Recipe Variatons to Try
I love this breakfast quesadilla recipe because it’s so easy to customize depending on your tastes.
Since the hubster and I love scrambled eggs, bacon, green peppers, and cheese, those were my go-to ingredients for this dish. But, if you prefer sausage, add it in!
Hate green peppers? Leave those out. Like feta? Throw it in! The possibilities are endless.

Switch up the veggies! Mushrooms, red bell peppers, spinach, and/or onions would make a delicious addition.
Experiment with different spices! Garlic powder, seasoning salt, Italian seasoning, thyme…the possibilites are endless.
Don’t forget the cheese! Mozzarella, Cheddar Jack or Feta would be so tasty.
Add more meat! Swap out the bacon with breakfast sausage, add some chorizo or diced ham.



Tips for Making Breakfast Quesadillas 

Be sure to not cook the eggs too long, as they will be heated on the tortilla after cooking. You don’t want tough eggs!
I chose not to sauté the green peppers before adding to the eggs, which keeps them slightly crunchy. If you prefer softened green peppers, sauté them in a tablespoon of unsalted butter/oil until softened before adding to eggs.
Use butter or cooking spray on your heated skillet before adding tortilla shell. This will help it achieve that golden brown color.

Toppings for Breakfast Quesadillas 
This is a super simple breakfast idea that can be enjoyed on its own, or paired with dipping sauces and sides to round out your morning meal. 
Here are some toppings you can pile onto these bacon and egg quesadillas: 

Restaurant-Style Salsa 
Zesty Guacamole 
Sour cream 
Fresh cilantro 
Jalapeños 
Hot sauce 
Pico de gallo 
Shredded cheese 

If you love breakfast for dinner (or brinner) like I do, then you’ll adore this quick breakfast idea. Breakfast ideas with eggs are so good!
You might even say this would the one meal that you would ask for if stranded on a desert island!

Dessert Island answer is DEFINITELY breakfast…because of bacon of course!  And I would have to make these quesadillas to go with the bacon! 🙂

If I were stranded on a desert island, I’d want the chocolate with me. But for breakfast, I’d want this. I really love quesadillas of all kinds, and breakfast ones are so filling and delicious. All that cheesy goodness!

What an awesome idea, Gayle!  I love quesadillas, but never had in breakfast form and who doesn’t like breakfast?  I think if I were stranded on an island, it would have to be breakfast.  Oh, and a breakfast pizza?  Yes, please!  I’ll take that too 🙂  Now your just making me hungry, lol :D.  Pinning and making real soon.

This is so smart!  I’ve made lots of quesadillas in my time – I even did a quesadilla bar for a party back when I catered – but I can honestly say I’ve never made a breakfast quesadilla!  So smart.

It can’t say if I’d want a particular meal, but I would want access to all the fruit. Would that count as breakfast? These quesadillas look amazing, Gayle. And while I probably wouldn’t eat them for breakfast, I would definitely chow down on something like this for lunch!!

If I was stranded on an island I would most definitely choose breakfast.  But I’m loving your idea of choosing pizza for breakfast!  Sneaky!  😉  There was a place back in FL that had the best breakfast quesadillas and I would order them whenever we went there for brunch.  Since moving to NC I haven’t had a breakfast quesadilla so I am loving that you posted this!!  These sound absolutely perfect, Gayle!  Packed with breakfast deliciousness!  Totally making these over the weekend!!  Pinned! Cheers, friend!

Love that you and I are so similar. My favorite is breakfast and pizza too. There are more in there, but those two are by far my favs. I’m loving these quesadillas. The kids would devour them. Gonna make them this coming weekend. 🙂

If I were stranded on a desert island I’d want endless bowls of popcorn and pans of macaroni and cheese. Although, I’m sure none of that would actually be possible on a desert island, but that’s what I would want 😉 These breakfast quesadillas look delicious! I always do scrambled eggs and pepper jack, but now I’m totally adding bacon and peppers to amp them up!

Hi Robert! I’ve never made this for just one before, but I would roughly use two eggs, a few tablespoons of milk, and adjust the rest of the ingredients. I’ve kept this in the fridge for up to two days before and it’s reheated wonderfully. Hope you love it if you try it!

Beef Stew with Carrots & Potatoes
Tested & Perfected RecipesCookbook Recipe

With over 4,000 5-star reviews, this classic French beef stew is the all-time most popular recipe on my website. It is the ultimate cold weather comfort food. Chunks of well-marbled beef are seared in a hot pan, then gently braised with garlic and onions in a rich wine-based broth. After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly tender and enveloped in a deeply flavorful sauce. It takes a few hours to make, but the recipe is mostly hands-off. Go ahead and make it a day or two ahead of time; the flavor improves the longer it sits.



This stew is part of my classic French recipe collection, which includes similar slow-cooking comfort food recipes, like coq au vin and red wine braised short ribs, and impressive main courses, like steak au poivre or roast beef tenderloin with red wine sauce.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED TO MAKE BEEF STEW WITH CARROTS & POTATOES
how to make beef stew



The most important thing is to start with the right cut of meat. You want to buy chuck roast that is well-marbled—that means it should have a good amount of white veins of fat running through it. Stay away from meat generically packaged as “stew meat,” especially if it looks lean (I can guarantee you it will not get tender, no matter how long you cook it).

For the wine, use any dry red (Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, etc.) that is inexpensive but still good enough to drink.

HOW TO MAKE BEEF STEW WITH CARROTS & POTATOES
caroline.r.baines@gmail.com

Begin by removing any large chunks of fat that are easy to get to (like the one my knife is pointing to below), but don’t overdo it with the trimming, as the fat helps make the beef tender.

Next, season the meat generously with salt and pepper.

AD
Heat a bit of oil in a Dutch oven or large pot and brown the meat in batches.

This step is a bit time-consuming but browning the meat adds depth and dimension to the stew. (Note: it’s important not to crowd the pan — if you try to brown all the meat at once, it will steam instead of sear and you won’t get all that lovely color and flavor.)


AD
This step is a bit time-consuming  but browning the meat adds depth and dimension to the stew.

Remove the meat and add the onions, garlic, and balsamic vinegar to the pan. The vinegar will loosen all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan and add flavor.

Feel free to adapt the recipe to your liking. You can leave out the potatoes and serve it over buttered egg noodles, or toss in some frozen peas or sautéed mushrooms at the very end. Either way, it’s soul-satisfying comfort food for a cold night.

Beef Stew with Carrots & Potatoes
METRIC 
 CUP MEASURES
By Jenn Segal
This classic French beef stew is the ultimate cold weather comfort food. After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly tender and enveloped in a rich wine sauce.

Servings: 6
Total Time: 3 Hours 30 Minutes
INGREDIENTS

AD
3 pounds boneless beef chuck (well-marbled), cut into 1½-inch pieces
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium yellow onions, cut into 1-inch chunks
7 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1½ tablespoons tomato paste
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 cups dry red wine
2 cups beef broth
2 cups water
1 bay leaf
½ teaspoon dried thyme
1½ teaspoons sugar
4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks on a diagonal
1 pound small white boiling potatoes (baby yukons), cut in half
Fresh chopped parsley, for serving (optional)

COOK MODE - PREVENT SCREEN FROM GOING DARK
INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 325°F and set a rack in the lower middle position.
Pat the beef dry and season with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown the meat in 3 batches, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes per batch; add one tablespoon more oil for each batch. (To sear the meat properly, do not crowd the pan and let the meat develop a nice brown crust before turning with tongs.) Transfer the meat to a large plate and set aside.
Add the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the brown bits from bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more. Add the beef with its juices back to the pan and sprinkle with the flour. Stir with wooden spoon until the flour is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine, beef broth, water, bay leaf, thyme, and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours.


Remove the pot from the oven and add the carrots and potatoes. Cover and place back in oven for about an hour more, or until the vegetables are cooked, the broth is thickened, and the meat is tender. Fish out the bay leaf and discard, then taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve the stew warm -- or let it come to room temperature and then store in the refrigerator overnight or until ready to serve. This stew improves in flavor if made at least 1 day ahead. Reheat, covered, over medium heat. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.
Note: If you don’t have a Dutch oven or covered pot that is appropriate for the oven, the stew can be cooked on the stove. The timing will be the same and it should be cooked over the lowest setting.
Freezer-Friendly Instructions: The stew can be frozen for up to 3 months. Before serving, defrost the stew in the refrigerator for 24 hours and then reheat on the stovetop over medium-low heat until hot.

Another day, another oatmeal bowl! If you’ve enjoyed my Peanut Butter Oatmeal and Chocolate Oatmeal, you’ll absolutely love this Banana Oatmeal. Like the former recipes, this oatmeal bowl is sweet, thick, creamy, and totally delicious. It practically tastes like dessert for breakfast!

This stovetop oatmeal recipe uses pantry staples. I bet you already have all of the ingredients in your kitchen. It includes rolled oats, almond milk, bananas, maple syrup, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. From start to finish, you can make this meal in 15 minutes or less.

Since oatmeal is a hearty, high fiber breakfast, it provides long lasting energy that fuels your whole morning. You can customize it by adding your favorite mix-ins and toppings, like protein powder, chocolate chips, peanut butter, and more.

This banana oatmeal is:

Vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, and oil-free
Sweet, thick, creamy, and comforting
Made with no refined sugar
Naturally sweetened with overripe bananas

Ingredients for banana oatmeal
Oats: Rolled oats are the best choice for stovetop oatmeal. They have been steamed and flattened, which helps create a thick and creamy texture. You can use quick oats, if needed, but do not use steel cut oats for this recipe.
Bananas: Use spotty overripe bananas. The peel should be yellow with brown specks all over it. This level of ripeness will provide the sweetest flavor and creamiest consistency.
Almond milk: Add almond milk or any type of milk, such as oat milk, coconut milk, or even dairy milk.
Water: We’ll use half water (and half milk) for the liquid portion of the recipe.
Maple syrup: Adding a sweetener, like maple syrup, is optional. You may think it is unnecessary because the banana is sweet enough on its own. Alternatively, use honey, agave nectar, or coconut sugar.
Vanilla: Make your oatmeal taste like dessert by adding vanilla extract. It provides a sweet, dessert-like flavor and aroma.
Cinnamon: This healthy spice is anti-inflammatory and adds warm flavor.
Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other ingredients.

How to make healthy oatmeal with banana
For the full ingredient measurements and step-by-step instructions, scroll down to view the recipe card at the bottom of the page.

First, combine all ingredients in a small pot. This includes rolled oats, almond milk, water, mashed banana, maple syrup (optional), vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt.

Next, transfer the pot to a stovetop and cook over medium-high heat. Frequently stir the oatmeal so it does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Cook until thick and creamy, about 7-8 minutes. The longer you cook, the thicker and creamier it will become.

Then, transfer the oatmeal to bowl(s). Add your favorite toppings, like fresh fruit, nut butter, granola, nuts, seeds, and more. Enjoy!

What can I put in my oatmeal?
Switch up this oatmeal recipe every time and you’ll never grow tired of it! Try any of the oatmeal mix-ins below.

Nut butter: Add a spoonful of almond butter or peanut butter for a boost of healthy fats.
Protein powder: Instantly elevate it into high protein oatmeal. Just stir in a scoop of your favorite protein powder while cooking.
Cocoa or cacao powder: If you love chocolate, add a tablespoon of cocoa or cacao powder.
Seeds: Stir in a tablespoon of chia seeds, hemp seeds, or flax seeds. This will add a boost of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
What toppings are good on oatmeal?
There are endless options for oatmeal toppings. I’ve listed my favorite recommendations below.

Berries: Add fresh blueberries, raspberries, or strawberries for antioxidants and a burst of tart flavor.
Nut butter: Drizzle peanut butter or almond butter on top.
Granola: Sprinkle granola clusters on top for a crunchy texture.
Coconut: Add coconut flakes or coconut shreds for a tropical flavor.
Dark chocolate: If you’re a chocolate lover, add dark chocolate chips on top. It will taste like dessert! In order to keep things healthy, I always use stevia-sweetened chocolate chips.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
Is oatmeal with banana good for you?

Absolutely! This banana oatmeal recipe is made with healthy ingredients. It is vegan, gluten-free, oil-free, and contains no refined sugar. It’s packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

Is banana oatmeal healthy for weight loss?

Yes, banana oatmeal can be included in a healthy weight loss diet. Since oatmeal is a low calorie and high fiber breakfast, it helps you stay full for hours. Oats are a slow digesting carbohydrate, which is more satisfying than quick digesting carbohydrates (like cereal and toast).

What is the healthiest fruit to put in oatmeal?

Any type of fruit can be a healthy oatmeal topping. While these oats are made with mashed banana, you can add extra fruit on top. Try adding fresh berries for a boost of antioxidants and extra fiber.

Can I meal prep oatmeal?

Yes, you can meal prep oatmeal! However, I do not recommend meal prepping hot oatmeal. Instead, meal prep overnight oats. Follow my Banana Overnight Oats recipe.

Can I save leftovers?

Yes, you can save leftover oatmeal, but I don’t recommend it. This banana oatmeal is best enjoyed immediately after making it.

Ingredients
UNITS USM
SCALE
1X
2X
3X
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup almond milk (or any type of milk)
1 cup water
1 spotty ripe banana, mashed
1 tbsp maple syrup (optional)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp salt
Toppings of choice (fresh fruit, nut butter, nuts, seeds, etc.)
Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark
Instructions
Combine all ingredients in a small pot.
Transfer the pot to a stovetop and cook over medium-high heat. Frequently stir the oatmeal so it does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Cook until thick and creamy, about 7-8 minutes. The longer you cook, the thicker and creamier it will become.
Transfer oatmeal to bowl(s). Add your favorite toppings, like fresh fruit, nut butter, granola, nuts, seeds, and more. Enjoy!
Notes
How to make them gluten-free: If you follow a strict gluten-free diet, check to make sure your oats are certified gluten-free.
Oatmeal mix-ins: Protein powder, cocoa powder, nut butter, nuts, or seeds.
Oatmeal toppings: Fresh fruit, nut butter, granola, or dark chocolate.
How to store leftovers: This banana oatmeal is best enjoyed immediately after making it. I do not recommend storing leftovers. However, if needed, you can store them in a sealed container inside the refrigerator.

Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.Total Time10 minutesRating5(1,299)NotesRead community notesHow can you make runny-yolked fried eggs even better? Give them edges of crisp, salty Parmesan. The addition takes just a few extra minutes and adds an incredible layer to a dish that’s already deeply lovable. Make sure to skip preground Parmesan here: You’ll want to shred the cheese yourself on the largest holes of your grater. And use a nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast-iron pan to fry the eggs. They may never come off a regular pan. Eat them alone, lay them over asparagus, or use them to top a sharp, lemony salad. When something’s this perfect, it’s hard to go wrong however you serve it.Read MoreSaveLog in or sign up to save this recipe.GiveSubscriber benefit: give recipes to anyoneAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift recipes to give each month.

Uncover and turn heat to medium-high to finish cooking eggs for another 1 to 2 minutes, until edges are crisp and golden brown. Make sure the cheese doesn’t get too brown; if it goes past light golden, turn down heat.

I put a piece of baking parchment on a half sheet pan, spread the cheese out with 4 little 'nests' and put it in a 350 degree oven for 3 minutes, took out the pan and cracked an egg into each of the divots and returned it to the oven for 8 minutes. Perfect eggs, crispy cheese and easy clean up.Is this helpful? 392Marlene Heller4 years agoI've been making a version of this for years; just a lot simpler. I make the eggs, as I would normally, with butter in a non-stick pan. Sprinkle grated Parmesan or Parm/Reggiano on the eggs a minute before flipping to give them a minute to start melting. Then flip, and cook on the other side. Sprinkle cheese on that side too. Only cook for a minute, unless you want your eggs rock hard. Delicious.Is this helpful? 228Prakash Nadkarni4 years agoAs someone who prefers fried eggs over easy rather than sunny side up, I'm with Marlene on this one. Whether to trade esthetics for time in a recipe is a personal decision: it's presumptuous to tell others how they can and can't cook. Rustic French cooking, for example, skips the numerous decorative steps of French Banquet cooking, but is none the worse for its simplicity.Is this helpful? 78Dave3 years agoTry this in the oven! I put a piece of baking parchment on a half sheet pan, spread the cheese out with 4 little 'nests' and put it in a 350 degree oven for 3 minutes, took out the pan and cracked an egg into each of the divots and returned it to the oven for 8 minutes. Perfect eggs, crispy cheese and easy clean up.Is this helpful? 43John Neill4 years agoDear Marlene
You’ve not looked at the picture of the recipe-so you’ve gone ahead in supposedly ’easier’ way ( don’t we all love ‘easier’?! ) .. but you’d ruin the beautiful look of the UNflipped eggs!... don’t do it -please.
Sincerely.Is this helpful? 40Martha3 years agoI make this dish with added baby spinach.   Equally delicious and heartier.  I wilt (in microwave for one minute) a generous handful of baby spinach while the cheese is melting and lay the spinach layer right on top of the melted cheese.  Then I add the eggs and continue following the recipe.Is this helpful? 36Chris4 years agoMelissa Clark should be named America's Chef.  Another winning recipe.  I made it to the exact recipe following every step detailed. Oops, I take that back.  I did not add additional salt as I figured the cheese was salty enough.  It was perfect and delicious. It's a definite keeper.  Thank you, NYTimes Cooking.Is this helpful? 35Ellen4 years agoI love this recipe! The first time I made it, I didn’t have Parmesan; I used an aged cheddar and it came out great.Is this helpful? 25Leonardo Aranguibel4 years agoThis is great... I´ve done in the past with a slight variation: adding just a pinch of dried oregano and rosemary enhances the flavour amazingly!Is this helpful? 20Karen3 years agoTo up the ante, I'd melt an anchovy or two in the butter.Is this helpful? 18Mary4 years agoWould this work with Romano?  It sounds so good but I can’t get Parmesan soon and would like to try this idea.Is this helpful? 15jim teller4 years agoI prefer pecorino, too, but only had Asiago- and it finished perfectly. I’ll try with parmesan and pecorino next and report back.Is this helpful? 14Tyler4 years agothis was delicious - i ended up needing to use closer to 1c of cheese to provide enough coverage for 4 eggs, but everything else was spot on! i was afraid the eggs would burn/stick but the oil from the cheese make for a relatively painless cleanup.Is this helpful? 11Tammi3 years ago""A bit of parsley makes everything look like it was planned that way"" 

So true!Is this helpful? 11Carrie2 years agoI’m a salt lover, but I definitely advise NOT salting your eggs. The saltiness of the Parmesan cheese is more than enough.Is this helpful? 10Jill Mitchell2 weeks agoI put cooked, crumbled bacon bits in first. Then a lot of grated cheese, currently using Mexican blend. Then the eggs.  Small skillet. Lid. I usually flip for a minute before sliding onto my plate. Breakfast for one!!Is this helpful?maggie3 months agotastebuds woke up on the right side of the bed this morning with this oneIs this helpful?Kathy4 months agoMaybe use on top of creamed spinach for brunch.Is this helpful?Kate M.4 months agoThis was absolutely delicious, and such an easy way to elevate an otherwise standard breakfast. I adapted the recipe for one (so just a few tablespoons of Parmesan versus 1/2 cup, and only one egg), and it came out perfectly. I served with toasted multigrain bread and topped it with a half of an avocado. I’m already thinking about making this again tomorrow!Is this helpful?ben h7 months agoOh my god. These are great!Is this helpful?Anthony7 months agoWorks well, dry cheese works best not pre packaged stuff. I crisp the cheese on high with a little olive oil, lower place the eggs in the center. Make sure there is no sticking and your goof to go!Is this helpful?Meridith8 months agoHalved the recipe to make for just me. Perfect and delicious.Is this helpful?debra b8 months agoEasy on the salt - the cheese might be salty enough for most folks!Is this helpful?Stephanie8 months agoUsed oven method (see notes)-was tasty, but Parmesan did not crisp up and nest flattened. Try on stove next time or use egg ring in oven.Is this helpful?Jamie K8 months agoa nice easy way to jazz up sunny side up eggs! i added some aleppo pepper and chopped parsley to the cheese first to give it a little extra kick.Is this helpful? 1Heather8 months agoI used store bought “farm cut” Italian shredded cheese. Mozzarella and parmesan. I melted a pat of butter in nonstick pan, spread the cheese, waited 2 minutes, cracked the eggs, covered (& did not look!!!) for two more minutes and amazing!!! I have also chopped onion and peppers, sautéed them, then followed all previous directions putting the cheese right on top and then the egg. OMG. Tomorrow I will try this with onion, peppers, and bacon and then the cheese. The texture is insane and so delishIs this helpful? 1Charles Michener8 months agoI do a variation of this that adds a bacon-y flavor: Heat a nonstick pan along with a buttered egg ring (or several rings). Pour a very small amount of oil (1/4tsp) into the ring, then sprinkle copiously with smoked paprika. Gently drop in egg and let cook until sides are well set. Carefully remove ring, sprinkle parmesan on top, and cover pan for a few minutes. Eat on buttered English muffin.Is this helpful?Janet8 months agoI am always looking for a new way to cook eggs since I really do like them and always have them on hand.  This was great!  I grow flat leaf parsley in my garden here in Arizona year around which is a nice finishing touch. Agree that salt is not needed. I try to cut down on salt as much as I can.  
 Thank you.Is this helpful? 1Elle8 months agoStart with 1/2 c. grated potato (blotted dry), spread into lacy pancake, cook ‘til starting to brown, add the cheese, make a divot, then two eggs, cover pan til eggs are done. S&P to taste. Lift onto a tortilla with avocado and hot sauce!Is this helpful? 1Michael10 months agoThis is a great way to shake up the morning routine. I have done this similar recipe with asiago. And if I'm out of that I go for the feta which is a surprisingly good substitute!Is this helpful?Private notes are only visible to you.Recipe TagsEgg DishEggParmesanBreakfastBrunchEasyQuickMain

Perfect eggs, crispy cheese and easy clean up.Is this helpful? 43John Neill4 years agoDear Marlene
You’ve not looked at the picture of the recipe-so you’ve gone ahead in supposedly ’easier’ way ( don’t we all love ‘easier’?! ) .. but you’d ruin the beautiful look of the UNflipped eggs!... don’t do it -please.
Sincerely.Is this helpful? 40Martha3 years agoI make this dish with added baby spinach.   Equally delicious and heartier.  I wilt (in microwave for one minute) a generous handful of baby spinach while the cheese is melting and lay the spinach layer right on top of the melted cheese.  Then I add the eggs and continue following the recipe.Is this helpful? 36Chris4 years agoMelissa Clark should be named America's Chef.  Another winning recipe.  I made it to the exact recipe following every step detailed. Oops, I take that back.  I did not add additional salt as I figured the cheese was salty enough.  It was perfect and delicious. It's a definite keeper.  Thank you, NYTimes Cooking.Is this helpful? 35Ellen4 years agoI love this recipe! The first time I made it, I didn’t have Parmesan; I used an aged cheddar and it came out great.Is this helpful? 25Leonardo Aranguibel4 years agoThis is great... I´ve done in the past with a slight variation: adding just a pinch of dried oregano and rosemary enhances the flavour amazingly!Is this helpful? 20Karen3 years agoTo up the ante, I'd melt an anchovy or two in the butter.Is this helpful? 18Mary4 years agoWould this work with Romano?  It sounds so good but I can’t get Parmesan soon and would like to try this idea.Is this helpful? 15jim teller4 years agoI prefer pecorino, too, but only had Asiago- and it finished perfectly. I’ll try with parmesan and pecorino next and report back.Is this helpful? 14Tyler4 years agothis was delicious - i ended up needing to use closer to 1c of cheese to provide enough coverage for 4 eggs, but everything else was spot on! i was afraid the eggs would burn/stick but the oil from the cheese make for a relatively painless cleanup.Is this helpful? 11Tammi3 years ago""A bit of parsley makes everything look like it was planned that way"" 

So true!Is this helpful? 11Carrie2 years agoI’m a salt lover, but I definitely advise NOT salting your eggs. The saltiness of the Parmesan cheese is more than enough.Is this helpful? 10Jill Mitchell2 weeks agoI put cooked, crumbled bacon bits in first. Then a lot of grated cheese, currently using Mexican blend. Then the eggs.  Small skillet. Lid. I usually flip for a minute before sliding onto my plate. Breakfast for one!!Is this helpful?maggie3 months agotastebuds woke up on the right side of the bed this morning with this oneIs this helpful?Kathy4 months agoMaybe use on top of creamed spinach for brunch.Is this helpful?Kate M.4 months agoThis was absolutely delicious, and such an easy way to elevate an otherwise standard breakfast. I adapted the recipe for one (so just a few tablespoons of Parmesan versus 1/2 cup, and only one egg), and it came out perfectly. I served with toasted multigrain bread and topped it with a half of an avocado. I’m already thinking about making this again tomorrow!Is this helpful?ben h7 months agoOh my god. These are great!Is this helpful?Anthony7 months agoWorks well, dry cheese works best not pre packaged stuff. I crisp the cheese on high with a little olive oil, lower place the eggs in the center. Make sure there is no sticking and your goof to go!Is this helpful?Meridith8 months agoHalved the recipe to make for just me. Perfect and delicious.Is this helpful?debra b8 months agoEasy on the salt - the cheese might be salty enough for most folks!Is this helpful?Stephanie8 months agoUsed oven method (see notes)-was tasty, but Parmesan did not crisp up and nest flattened. Try on stove next time or use egg ring in oven.Is this helpful?Jamie K8 months agoa nice easy way to jazz up sunny side up eggs! i added some aleppo pepper and chopped parsley to the cheese first to give it a little extra kick.Is this helpful? 1Heather8 months agoI used store bought “farm cut” Italian shredded cheese. Mozzarella and parmesan. I melted a pat of butter in nonstick pan, spread the cheese, waited 2 minutes, cracked the eggs, covered (& did not look!!!) for two more minutes and amazing!!! I have also chopped onion and peppers, sautéed them, then followed all previous directions putting the cheese right on top and then the egg. OMG. Tomorrow I will try this with onion, peppers, and bacon and then the cheese. The texture is insane and so delishIs this helpful? 1Charles Michener8 months agoI do a variation of this that adds a bacon-y flavor: Heat a nonstick pan along with a buttered egg ring (or several rings). Pour a very small amount of oil (1/4tsp) into the ring, then sprinkle copiously with smoked paprika. Gently drop in egg and let cook until sides are well set. Carefully remove ring, sprinkle parmesan on top, and cover pan for a few minutes. Eat on buttered English muffin.Is this helpful?Janet8 months agoI am always looking for a new way to cook eggs since I really do like them and always have them on hand.  This was great!  I grow flat leaf parsley in my garden here in Arizona year around which is a nice finishing touch. Agree that salt is not needed. I try to cut down on salt as much as I can.  
 Thank you.Is this helpful? 1Elle8 months agoStart with 1/2 c. grated potato (blotted dry), spread into lacy pancake, cook ‘til starting to brown, add the cheese, make a divot, then two eggs, cover pan til eggs are done. S&P to taste. Lift onto a tortilla with avocado and hot sauce!Is this helpful? 1Michael10 months agoThis is a great way to shake up the morning routine. I have done this similar recipe with asiago. And if I'm out of that I go for the feta which is a surprisingly good substitute!Is this helpful?Private notes are only visible to you.Recipe TagsEgg DishEggParmesanBreakfastBrunchEasyQuickMain

Honeyed Blue Cheese Toast

 ""I *love* these. With a nice rich white wine... these are delicious, and easy breezy to make! This is another recipe that I make from the school of 'some'; there's really not amount to how much to use, just a 'bit' of everything. This recipe is great because your oven temp is not very important. Making a pie while making these? just stick it in the oven! All you need is for the cheese to melt and the bread, cheese, and honey to warm through.""

 Interesting.  I really enjoyed this with a few glasses of Tree-Free Chardonnay.  It paired well.  I softened my blue cheese and spread it because I had very thinly sliced baguette on hand and I didn't want there to be too much cheese.  It was very delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

 so simple, so good. I didn't even toast it, just spread the honey and the cheese on sesame wheat crackers - so I didn't really need a recipe, more an affirmation that the idea wasn't totally crazy when it struck me to combine honey with blue cheese. thanks for the affirmation anyway :)

 Very good indeed!!! I spread this on homemade multigrain bread. I mixed the cheese and honey together , and then spread the mixture on the bread.  It turned out brown and bubbly and yummy.  the only way this could possibly be better is maybe some walnuts added to this, but then again, if its not broke don't fix it!! thank you Desree42!!

 Easy and delicious! I used goat cheese instead of bleu cheese because my husband and our roommate don’t like bleu cheese. I’ll try it with bleu cheese next time though!

Are you on the hunt for the most delicious and crispy baked haddock? Well, your search ends with this recipe for the best baked haddock you've ever tasted. It's quick, easy, and has all the crispy goodness of fried fish without the mess of deep frying. We promise everyone at your table will love this delectable entree.


   How to Bake Haddock  

You'll find the full, step-by-step baked haddock recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you should expect:


  Bread the Haddock  

In one bowl, combine milk and salt. In a separate bowl combine the Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and thyme. Dip the haddock filet into the wet mixture, then into the dry mixture. Place on a baking dish and repeat with each remaining filet. Drizzle the fish with melted butter.


  Bake  

Bake the haddock until the fish is flaky and the crust is golden brown.


   How Long to Bake Haddock  

If you follow this recipe, you'll bake your fish at 500 degrees F for 15 minutes. This amount of time will result in perfectly flaky haddock with a nice crispy crust. You'll know the haddock is done when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F.


   What to Serve with Baked Haddock  

Baked haddock is a light main dish, so we love pairing it with a couple of sides. If you need a little inspiration, we recommend trying one of our 16 Most Popular Side Dishes to Serve With Fish. Here are a couple star recipes we love:

   Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  

""This is so simple to make and my husband and I thought it was awesome...definitely give it a try...I also added some garlic salt to the panko bread crumbs…can't wait to have it again,"" says SharonC.



""This was great! I followed the recipe almost exactly, just cutting down on the butter and thyme. The fish was so flaky and crispy. The high heat did really well,"" according to goodayathome. ""I think any spices would be great (garlic, onion, Old Bay, etc). Any mild fish would work too. Really good base recipe that you can tweak to your liking.""



""My family loves this fish! Even my picky 15 yr old nephew! The only change I make is that I add an amount equal to the thyme of black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to the cheese/breadcrumb mixture and I use Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular. It comes out nice and crispy and smells delicious,"" raves Tiffany J Brooks.

Today’s offering is more of a serving suggestion rather than a recipe, I guess.

I was at home alone the other day while Spouse took the kids back to school shopping. I poked my nose in the fridge to see what was there to skivver up a decent lunch.

In updating this recipe I am now using our incredibly popular Yogurt Flatbread Recipe. It’s basically just a couple of common ingredients with no yeast.

They take only a few minutes to make and the recipe is scaleable to make just a couple or as many as you like.

I found one leftover grilled chicken breast, a single grilled flatbread and a little ramekin of roasted tomato jam. Get the Roasted Tomato Jam recipe here.

This is quite a large sandwich, so in our house we generally share one with a side salad for a healthy and very satisfying meal. It should be noted that the calorie count is for the entire sandwich, so half that if you are sharing.

Bacon Grilled Cheese! What kind of magic is this?! Combining bacon with cheddar and pepper jack cheeses takes a classic grilled cheese sandwich to the next level!

Perfect for lunch served alongside tomato soup or with a smear of tomato jam. They are great for game day or movie night. Grilled cheese with bacon is a fancy, filling and flavorful take on a family favorite!

How to Make Bacon Grilled Cheese
Start with a bread thick enough to hold the melted cheese and heavy enough so it won’t fall apart. Grilled cheese with bacon (and tomato should you choose) needs hearty bread. Sourdough is a great choice!

Cook bacon slices until they are crisp. Remove the bacon and drain off all but about 1 tablespoon of bacon fat from the pan.
Spread mayonnaise on the outside of two slices of sourdough bread (or bread of your choice).
Layer the cheese and bacon (and optional tomato) over two slices of bread and top with remaining bread.
Grill those slices of heaven up!
Ingredients for Bacon Grilled Cheese on a wooden board
To Make Bacon Grilled Cheese: Reheat the pan you cooked the bacon in on low heat and let the bacon grease become fully melted.

Gently place the bacon grilled cheese sandwich mayonnaise side out in the center of the pan and cook until golden. Flip and continue cooking until you see the cheese oozing from the sides.

What to Serve with Grilled Cheese
Everything goes with a bacon grilled cheese sandwich!

Traditionally, it’s great with tomato soup (or any soup recipe you love)! On a warm day, we love to add in a tossed salad with a tangy vinaigrette. And nothing tastes better than washing it all down with an icy glass of Watermelon Lemonade!

I’m not clear on which sides of the bread you are spreading mayonnaise……both outsides of each sandwich? A video would have been helpful.

Thank you for the feedback Patricia. In this recipe, the mayonnaise is on the outside of the sandwich so it cooks directly on the skillet.

When you want a hot bowl of comfort but don’t want to slave over the stove for hours, this quick and easy Chicken Noodle Soup recipe is the perfect choice. It has the simple, clean flavors you expect from this classic, and it’s ready in 30 minutes.

There’s something to be said for the chicken noodle soup that takes 2 days to make, and starts from scratch with the whole chicken. But when you’re sick and also the cook of the household, homemade chicken broth is typically not in the cards. You need something easy!
For the past week I’ve been the kind of sick where at times you don’t even feel like you can watch TV in bed, and this easy Chicken Noodle Soup has helped me get by. It’s delicious, still homemade, and free of preservatives! It really hits the spot on cold nights.


Tips for Best Results
Use a quality chicken broth – I once did a taste test comparing several brands of chicken broth from the grocery store, and the differences were staggering. Since you’re not making the broth yourself from the whole bird, you need to start with a good broth. My favorite brands are Imagine and Swanson.
Season the soup well – If a soup is underseasoned, it’s difficult for the flavors to come through, even if there is a good mix of vegetables and herbs. The salt helps you taste the flavor.
Use a fresh herb – Soup is a very aromatic food, and herbs are all about aroma and flavor. They make a big difference here! Rosemary and thyme are my top recommendations.




The difference between broth and stock
Although many people think of them as interchangeable, it’s best to use broths for homemade soups. Broths are typically made more with meat whereas stocks are made more with bones, giving a different type of mouthfeel. A true broth will give you that classic chicken noodle soup flavor and feel that you’re going for.
When making quick soups like this one where you’re not really simmering anything, it’s important to use a broth that has a lot of flavor to begin with. It’s what lets you get away with such a quick preparation that still tastes delicious. 
I suggest buying a handful of brands from the store and doing your own taste test. I have found that brands vary hugely in terms of richness and flavor. I tend to like Swanson and Imagine.



Select your pasta
There’s a lot of customization that can happen for this soup overall, but especially with the noodles. You can add any kind of pasta you’d like, like stars, spirals, and more, but I really love a wide pappardelle egg noodle, as they remind me most of homemade noodles. 
You can also make this easy recipe much heartier by adding tortellini, like in my Chicken Spinach Tortellini Soup.

Step by Step Overview:
To get started, chop some carrots, onion and celery:

I include more carrots and celery stalks than what is traditional for a mirepoix because I love tasting the carrots and celery in every bite.
Sweat the carrots, onion, and celery in a large pot with a little bit of fat, salt, and pepper over medium heat:

Cook for about 10 minutes until the vegetables have softened:

Next add chicken broth, and your fresh herbs of choice. I like to add some fresh thyme or fresh rosemary. I usually do not bother adding bay leaves here because the simmering time is so short, but you may also add a bay leaf if you prefer.

If you don’t have any fresh herbs on hand, I recommend adding dried herbs. Try 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, dried rosemary, or dried thyme.
Make sure to buy a really good quality chicken broth for this, as the available options vary hugely in quality. If you google “best tasting chicken broths” you will see lots of posts where people did blind taste tests. My favorite brands are Imagine and Swanson, and I’ve noticed that these tend to rank well for others too.
Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce to a simmer:

After 10 minutes of simmering time, I add some finely chopped chicken seasoned with salt and pepper, which cooks very quickly. Simply chop it up on a cutting board into small pieces.
I’m using skinless chicken breasts here as my personal preference, but darker meat is a great choice too. For dark meat, I’d recommend chopping up boneless skinless chicken thighs, which will be a little bit more tender:

Simmer the chicken for just a couple minutes, until fully cooked through.
You can also add shredded pre-cooked chicken, either from a store-bought rotisserie chicken, or Crockpot Chicken Breast, which I often keep on hand. This is a great place to use any leftover chicken you’ve got in the refrigerator.
As far as the pasta goes, I boil the noodles separately and also store them separately from the liquid, to avoid that mushy disintegrated noodle texture. My absolute favorite here is wide egg noodles. Make sure to cook the noodles al dente, as they will soften further in the broth.


How to Serve
When you’re ready to serve the soup, add a handful of noodles to a bowl and ladle over the hot broth. Sometimes I will garnish the bowl of chicken noodle soup with a sprinkle of fresh parsley, a squeeze of lemon juice, or some extra thyme leaves.
This homemade chicken noodle soup recipe goes beautifully with a side of fresh Asiago Black Pepper Bread or some Drop Biscuits. You can also use gluten-free pasta here, or simply omit the noodles to make it low carb.



Suggested Pairings
For a really special lunch, you can try pairing the chicken noodle soup with something more elaborate, like a Waffle Iron Grilled Cheese Sandwich or Chicken Cordon Bleu Panini. Cheddar Scallion Biscuits are also lovely, or you could do a salad on the side like this Kale Caesar Salad.

Recipe FAQ and Tips
Can Chicken Noodle Soup be frozen? Yes, for up to three months. Leave extra room in the container to allow for expansion of the liquid. Also, chill the soup fully in the fridge before freezing.  How long is Chicken Noodle Soup good for? It lasts a solid 5 days at a minimum, though I can usually keep it for 7 days in the coldest part of the fridge. I recommend storing the noodles separately, in an airtight container.  How do you prevent soggy noodles? I recommend boiling the noodles separately and also storing them separately from the liquid, to avoid that mushy disintegrated noodle texture. Add the noodles just before serving.  Can you make this easy chicken soup in the slow cooker? Yes, though I’m not sure it’s worth the trouble since it requires a lot of extra time, and the flavor is not as good when the veggies aren’t sauteed. Using the instant pot may be a better option. To use the slow cooker, combine all ingredients except the pasta in the crock pot, and cook on low for about 4 hours, until the meat is cooked through. Then I would still cook the pasta separately in a large stockpot and add it as needed to each bowl before serving.

Instructions Heat a soup pot over medium heat, then add the olive oil, celery, carrots, onion, salt, and black pepper. Cook for 10 minutes until softened.Add the chicken broth and thyme, bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer over low heat.Simmer for 10 minutes, then add the chopped chicken and simmer for 3 minutes, until the meat is cooked through.Taste the broth and make any necessary seasoning adjustments. Depending on the salt content of the broth you use, it may need additional salt.  Serve the soup in bowls with a handful of noodles added to each one. Enjoy!
Notes*Or you can do a few sprigs of fresh rosemary.
**I prefer to cook the noodles in a separate pot of boiling water per package instructions, and store them separately from the soup so the leftovers don’t get mushy and dissolved. 
Freezing: Store for up to three months. Leave extra room in the container to allow for expansion of the liquid. Also, chill the soup fully in the fridge before freezing.
Leftovers: This lasts a solid 5 days in the fridge at a minimum, though I can usually keep it for 7 days in the coldest part of the fridge. I recommend storing the noodles separately.

Need to par boil the chicken to get rid of surface scum for clear broth-taste is good but because of this looks were not appealing . Sorry

My FAVORITE thing to make, anytime of the year, day, night, is chicken noodle soup! My whole family loves AND when someone’s is sick, well they’re getting soup.! I sometimes will add a can of chopped chiles, it helps if you have a bad chest cold!
This may sound weird, but, I like reading other people recipe, AND, I enjoyed reading yours. Thank-you, Judi

Such simple ingredients & instructions. Great tip with dicing raw chicken breast. I added 1 heaping TBS Low Sodium Better Than Bouillon at end for additional flavoring. Excellent, fast, easy, delicious recipe- Thank you!

 A very filling and scrumptiously good breakfast which I served with a wholegrain English muffin and the only change I made was to use red capsicum/bell pepper instead of green.  Made for Name that Ingredient tag game.

 I cooked this up for my DH this morning and he gave it 5 stars! I left out the mushrooms(didn't have) and added a few more of the other veggies. My DH ate it with ketchup. Thanks Kitten!

 A wonderful breakfast. I used a bit of water to soften the veggies in place of the butter and fat free evaporated milk for the cream with low fat cheese and a bit more green pepper. I topped it with some warmed salsa and enjoyed it completely. A healthy and cheerful wake up meal

 It is often difficult to add fresh veggies to breakfast or brunch and this recipe really helped out.  I reduced the amount of butter and used fresh from the garden bell peppers and tomatoes.  I used egg substitute for the eggs.  Nice and tasty and packed full of vegetables.  Thanks

How to Make An OmeletteLearn how to make an omelette! This simple recipe is easy to master, and it's delicious with any filling you like. Try fresh herbs, vegetables, or cheese!
Jump to recipe





This omelette recipe is a staple in our kitchen, and my hope is that it will be in yours too. It’s hands down my favorite method for how to make an omelette. I love it because the results are fantastic (think fluffy, tender, just-set eggs), but it’s easy to master. With a little practice, you’ll be able to pull off a perfect omelette every time!Make one for a hearty breakfast, or whip one up for a quick and easy lunch or dinner. The beauty of this omelette recipe is that it’s a delicious option for any meal. Plus, you can stuff it with whatever you like. Go all out with seasonal veggies, or keep it simple with a filling of fresh herbs and cheese. Either way, I think you’ll love it!




How to Make An OmeletteThe traditional French technique for how to make an omelette involves agitating the eggs with a fork as they cook to form pillowy curds. In this basic omelette recipe, I use a different method that’s common in the US. Instead of beating the eggs, I form curds by pulling cooked egg from the edges of the pan into its center with a spatula. It yields a delicious omelette, and I’ve found it to be a bit more foolproof than the classic approach.Here’s how it goes:First, beat the eggs. Crack them into a medium bowl and whisk to combine the egg whites and yolks. Season with a pinch of salt.




Next, heat the pan. To make a 2-egg omelette, you’ll need an 8-inch skillet, preferably nonstick. Heat it over medium heat, and then coat the bottom with butter or oil.Then, pour in the egg mixture. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook without stirring until the edges of the eggs just begin to set, about 10 seconds.




Use a spatula to work around the edges of the omelette, dragging the cooked egg into the center of the pan. Let the uncooked egg flow to the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan as needed to direct the runny egg.




Repeat until the uncooked egg begins to thicken and move more slowly to the edges of the pan.




At this point, use your spatula to gently smooth the raw egg into an even layer. Cook without stirring until the eggs are mostly set. Then, add your desired fillings to one side of the eggs.Fold to close and cook until the eggs are just set. Remove from the heat, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve!




Omelette Recipe Tips
Pick the right pan. When you’re choosing what pan to use for this recipe, you’ll need to consider two factors: size and pan type. The size will determine the thickness of your omelette. For a 2-egg omelette, you’ll need an 8-inch skillet. I also recommend using a nonstick pan here. Most are fairly lightweight and easy to lift and tilt as you cook, unlike heavier stainless steel or cast iron. Plus, the nonstick surface makes it SO much easier to cook a fluffy, intact omelette.
And then preheat it. You want the pan to be hot when you add the eggs—they should sizzle when you pour them in. Then, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. Starting the omelette on a hot surface will help it cook quickly and form fluffy curds. Reducing the heat helps the eggs cook through without browning.
Work quickly. Eggs cook fast! In order to cook an omelette with fluffy curds and minimal browning, you’ll need to move the eggs almost constantly until the bottom of the omelette is set.
When the uncooked egg starts to thicken, gently spread it in an even layer. You won’t end up with a pool of raw egg in the middle of your omelette, and it’ll have a more uniform round shape, ideal for enclosing your favorite omelette fillings.




Omelette Recipe VariationsSo, you learned how to make an omelette. Now for the fun part: filling it!You can use almost any cooked veggie, fresh herb, or cheese here. Have fun creating a delicious filling with your favorite ingredients!Want some ideas to get started? Here are a few filling combos I love:
Sautéed asparagus, avocado, pea shoots, and feta or goat cheese (pictured here)
Sautéed spinach, sautéed mushrooms, and Swiss cheese
Diced bell peppers, onion, and cheddar cheese
Roasted tomatoes, basil, and fresh mozzarellaOr make a simple cheese omelette filled with a few tablespoons of ricotta. Top it off with a sprinkle of fresh dill, parsley, or chives.Enjoy!

Some prefer bacon, but I’ve always been more of a breakfast sausage person. From zesty and peppery, to sweet maple sausages, it’s all SO good!

If sausage links and eggs seem a bit too plain today, this list was made for you!

Try something new like breakfast quesadillas or a fun sausage breakfast salad.
Either way it’s time to get your breakfast, brunch, or brinner on. 
Browse this list of 17 hearty and delicious sausage and egg recipes to find your new favorite!

1. Sausage and Egg Breakfast Quesadillas
Okay, the holy trifecta of quesadilla fillings here. Pepper jack cheese, eggs, and sausage in a crunchy tortilla? Yes, please!
You can really create these quesadillas in so many ways to fit your fancy. For this particular recipe, you only need four ingredients!
I’ve yet to find a sausage that isn’t good in breakfast quesadillas. All seasonings, shapes, and sizes of sausages are welcome here!

Go to Recipe


2. Egg Sausage Casserole
Breakfast casseroles are the bomb for brunches. They’re easy, filling, and always delicious. Right?
This particular casserole is all proteins, so it’s a great partner for waffles or French toast. 
Cottage cheese may just be the secret ingredient to soft and creamy egg casseroles.
I love making these in muffin tins, too! You can freeze and warm them later for a quick breakfast on the go!

Go to Recipe


3. Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Scramble
I mean, who can say no to scrambled eggs, sausage links, and cheese? It’s an easy, cheesy, and hearty start to the day. 
I can’t get enough maple sausage links, but any variation of links will do. Add in a touch of onion for a more savory scramble.

The best scrambled eggs are creamy, like these with heavy cream. I also love a bit of creme fraiche in my scramble like the classic Gordon Ramsay recipe, too!

Go to Recipe


4. Low-Carb Egg and Sausage Bake
Who says comfort foods have to be loaded with carbs? We all know protein is the best way to keep your body going, so ditch the toast and potatoes.
Andouille sausage is the star of this recipe. You can get so many flavors, and the texture of sausage slices and over-easy eggs… *chefs kiss*
Add cheese and veggies, or keep it simple. A few ingredients and a few minutes is all you need!

Go to Recipe


5. Breakfast Sliders
Holy brunch, Batman! These sliders are the ultimate guest pleasing, finger-food-friendly, tasty breakfast sandwiches around.
The key to layering the sliders is baking your eggs in the casserole dish you’ll bake the sliders in. 
They come out in a sheet perfect to lay on top of the slider bottoms.
Then, sprinkle on your sausage and add cheese to hold it all together. 
Glaze the buns with maple butter to have a sweet, savory, and scrumptious little slider for all to enjoy.

Go to Recipe


6. Easy Sausage Quiche
I’ll never know why, but quiches are so sophisticated in my mind. Something about the flaky crust and savory fillings is divine. 
It almost makes me feel like a queen at the breakfast table!
If you want an easy quiche, use pre-made pie crust! It has all the flake and flavor you want, and none of the work.
Layer the eggs, sausage, cheese, and onion into the crust and bake! It’s an easy way to start your day, any time of the year.

Go to Recipe


7. Sausage and Mushroom Breakfast Frittata
Healthy eating is all about balance, right? Veggies, meats, and eggs all in one frittata is the way to go.
This frittata has mushrooms, tomatoes, and spinach baked into the egg and sausage mix. 
In the same pan, cook your sausage and veggies. Add the creamy eggs and mozzarella cheese, bake and enjoy!

Go to Recipe


8. McDonald’s Sausage and Egg McMuffin
There’s no need to hit the drive-thru with this simple copycat egg McMuffin! 
This tasty classic is so easy to assemble at home and saves you money at the same time.
Use an egg ring to cook your egg in that classic round shape. On your English muffin, layer the cheese, egg, and sausage and you’re ready to go!
If you’re feeling eager, you can fry up some hash brown patties for the whole McDonald’s meal. 

Go to Recipe


9. Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Breakfast Burritos
Breakfast burritos are my go-to for freezer-friendly breakfasts everyone will love. It’s always great to have an easy burrito recipe on hand!
This recipe has bacon and sausage rolled into a flour tortilla. Of course, don’t forget the eggs and cheese!
You can add or omit ingredients as you like with this recipe. Hash browns are a great filler to add for more burritos and less cost!

Go to Recipe


10. Egg and Sausage Sandwich
This is the ultimate breakfast grilled cheese sandwich. 
Gooey melted mozzarella and savory sausage are partners in crime. Smother the bread with garlic tomato paste for a rich and acidic flavor. 
The finishing touch is jalapenos for an irresistible sandwich. Toast them in a pan until crunchy and golden brown, and voila! 

Go to Recipe


11. Breakfast Pizza With Sausage, Bacon, and Scrambled Eggs
I know the internet was up in arms about the Taco Bell pizza, but have you had breakfast pizza? It’s to die for! 
All the breakfast staples are loaded onto a pizza crust and baked to perfection. 
If you have kids in your life, this is a total winner for breakfast any day of the week!

Go to Recipe


12. Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Biscuit Casserole
I’m all about biscuits and gravy, so when I found this recipe, I knew it would be a hit! 
Cut up pre-made biscuits and spread them in a casserole dish. Then cover them with sausage, eggs, cheese, and of course gravy!
This is one of those recipes you don’t need to adapt. It’s just that good. 
And you don’t even need to know what to serve with biscuits and gravy. It’s hearty enough on its own.

Go to Recipe


13. Eggs in Purgatory With Sausage
Poached eggs in a zesty marinara sauce AND sausage? Yes, please!
This is a one-pan-wonder breakfast that is a total show stopper. 
It has warm and flavorful Italian seasonings, eggs cooked to perfection, and no mess to clean up.
The best eggs in purgatory have an ample amount of melted provolone and parmesan. Oh, don’t forget the fresh basil!

Go to Recipe


14. Breakfast Salad
I know it sounds crazy, but a healthy breakfast salad is an incredible way to start the day. 
Picture a chunky guacamole with sausage and eggs. You can absolutely add more to this recipe, but it’s so good as it is.
Full of nutritious ingredients, it’s a great way to fuel your body for a busy day. 

Go to Recipe


15. Sausage Breakfast Tacos
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Tacos are the supreme ruler of meal time! 
Eggs, sausage, peppers, and cheese all taste better in a warm corn tortilla. 
Of course, you can add your favorite taco fixings, but why mess with perfection?
Breakfast taco bars are one of my favorite brunch setups. It’s totally customizable and easy to make for a large crowd!

Go to Recipe


16. Polish White Borscht
Soup for breakfast? Sounds like a warm and hearty start to your busy morning.
Potatoes, boiled eggs, and Polish sausage make a hearty bulk to the borscht. 
The thick and creamy soup base is full of sausage flavor to pull the dish together.
This is a classic Polish breakfast for Easter weekend, but it’s scrumptious any day or time!

Go to Recipe


17. Lazy Sunday Breakfast Dumplings
Pot-stickers for breakfast?! My only regret is not trying this recipe sooner.
Turkey sausage and garlic eggs in wonton wrappers are pan-fried to perfection. The sauces are finger-licking-good.
Try one, or try them both. Either way, this is a five-star breakfast you’ll rave over.

SHARE THIS POST:



Sausages, bacon, potato chips, jalapeños, onions and cheese in a golden buttered toast. Say hello to the ultimate Bacon and Sausage Sandwich


Recipe ⬇️Step-by-step guide ⬇️
You need to make this sandwich!
This one ain’t pretty but that’s ok because it makes up for it in taste, let’s just say that it’s bloody delicious! 
This sandwich was a request made by my dear (and demanding) husband Tomasi, and this was how it came about.
A few weeks ago I was preparing dinner whilst my toddler Kai was strapped in his high chair. He was furiously slamming the spatular I gave him against his tray, this was Kai’s way of telling me he was bored and wanted to play with something else. He gives me a few seconds to attend to his need before he chucks the spatular. I should say ‘try to chuck’ as he is still uncoordinated with his throwing skills and it just ends up falling flatly on the floor.







Our front door swings open and Tomasi walks into the kitchen excitedly. He just came home from work, which just recently he was made to go back into his office in the city for two days a week. 
‘You need to make this sandwich!’ Tomasi blurted out breathlessly.
I had no idea what he was on about so I didn’t bother to respond but Kai did, he giggled and shouted ‘UH OH’ to his daddy.
And uh oh was pretty much accurate from Kai. I know my husband! If he was excited about a sandwich it would’ve been because it was extremely high in calories, meaty and cheesy.  
I was 100% correct!

What men talk about during lunch breaks 
Tomasi went to fill his water bottle in his work kitchen when he bumped into two male colleagues gawking at a photo on a phone. By the way that they were carrying on excitedly, Tomasi was sure that they were looking at inappropriate content that was NSFW (not safe for work). So he walked past hoping they didn’t see him but one of them grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him over ‘Mate, you’ve gotta check this bloody thing out! 
With trepidation, Tomasi glanced over at his phone. His fear instantly turned into hunger when he saw a mouthwatering stack of bacon and sausage sandwiches.






Tomasi couldn’t remember the source or the web article so unfortunately, I’m unable to credit the person who inspired this sandwich. But funny enough Tomasi recalls every little detail of the sandwich.
I was ready to act disgusted when he finished describing this ultimate sandwich but stupid me got lured in. After hearing that this sandwich had crispy potato chips and jalapeños did it for me, I was so ready to recreate this monster!

The Ultimate Bacon and Sausage sandwich
Firstly, let me just say that my husband and I hardly ever agree on anything these days, so to say that we wholeheartedly agreed that this sandwich was ‘frickin delicious’ is HUGE! 
For such a high-calorie sandwich, it surprisingly didn’t taste too greasy. It’s a breakfast sandwich turned into an all-day sandwich! Even better, I would say a hangover sandwich, I can imagine myself in my twenties devouring this up after a big night out. 






The filling works perfectly together to create that party in your mouth! The delicious grilled onions, meaty sausage, salty crispy bacon, melted cheese and kick from the jalapeños.
I tweaked a few things, Tomasi said the original sandwich had onion and pickle relish. I didn’t have any at home so I swapped this with sliced onions cooked the good old Aussie way, over a skillet. 
The next time I would also change the placement of the potato chips, I felt it got lost after being toasted next to the cheese. I would place the chips in after the sandwich was pressed or grilled.
I usually trial recipes many times over before posting it here, however, I feel that this naughty but ‘oh it’s so good’ sandwich is yummy enough to skip the queue. 





Ingredients for The Ultimate Bacon and Sausage Sandwich

Everyone has their own preference on how they like sandwiches. That’s why I say use the ingredients you love as you’ll be the one eating it!  Use this recipe as a guide but use your favourite ingredients. So for example, sausage meat can be chicken, pork etc and the potatoes chips can be any flavour you prefer.
Bacon – My preferred bacon is ‘streaky’ because it has the right amount of fat and meat. 
Sausages – I used thin pork sausages.
Cheese slices – I use processed burger cheese as I felt it suited this type of grilled sandwich. You can use your favourite variety of cheese, just as long as it melts nicely when heated. 
Potato chips (crisp) – I used Smith’s original salted potato chips.






How to make The Ultimate Bacon and Sausage Sandwich
Step by step guide with photos

Cook the bacon, sausages and onions in a skillet







Preheat the sandwich press or grill (broiler) on medium-high heat. Butter a side of each bread slice.
Heat up a skillet on medium heat, there is no need to add oil as the bacon will produce it. Add in the bacon and cook for a minute or so, before adding in the sausages and onion. Turn them occasionally and cook until the bacon and sausages are cooked through and the onions have wilted.





Load up that sandwich!











If using a grill, toast the bread slices with the buttered side facing towards the heat and grill until it has toasted nicely.  If preferred toast the non-buttered side but this is not necessary.
Slice the sausages in half lengthwise and place the flat side on top of a slice of bread (buttered side face down). Top the sausages with mayo, mustard, ketchup, jalapeños, onions, bacon and cheese. 
If grilling carefully put the sandwich under the grill just until the cheese melts. Take it out of the grill and place the chips on top of the melted cheese and close it with a toasted slice. 
If using a sandwich press you can either add the chips before or after you have pressed it. Put the entire sandwich and press it just until the cheese has melted. Serve immediately and  ENJOY!

Fasolakia: Greek Green Beans
Egyptians call it Fasolia. Greeks call it Fasolakia. More accurately, Fasolakia Lathera, or braised green beans. Actually, the word Lathera means, ""ones with oil,"" and it describes a whole category of Greek dishes where vegetables are meant to literally swim in quality extra virgin olive oil. Nothing better, in my opinion. You can find similar olive oil-heavy dishes in other parts of the Mediterranean as well. For example, in Turkey, they have zeytinyağlı yemekler, which means “olive oil dishes""(like these braised leeks with garlic).

These Greek green beans are braised in tomatoes and extra virgin olive oil with onions, garlic and spices. Then, they are finished with lemon juice, fresh herbs, and more extra virgin olive oil.

So, unlike crunchy steamed or sauteed green beans, these Greek green beans are velvety, tender, but certainly not mushy.

There are as many variations of traditional Greek green beans as you can imagine. Every household has it's twist. In this recipe, I used potatoes to give the beans more substance as a vegan entree.

What to serve with Greek Green Beans
All you really need is some good Greek pita bread or your favorite rustic bread to sop up the sauce. But, to serve these green beans simply as a side, you can add rice and your favorite protein like grilled chicken or lamb. I typically prepare a simple Greek salad or this 3-ingredient Mediterranean salad to start the meal.

 PIN RECIPE
All-star recipe for Greek Green Beans. Velvety, tender green beans & potatoes, braised in a tomato-olive oil sauce. Flavor-packed, satisfying, vegan, and gluten-free.

INGREDIENTS
SCALE
1x
2x
3x
Greek extra virgin olive oil (I used Private Reserve Extra Virgin Olive Oil)
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
5 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp dried oregano
1 28-oz can peeled whole tomato
1 cup water
1 bay leaf
1 ½ lb fresh French green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 ½-inch pieces (frozen green beans work wonderfully in this recipe)
3 Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 lb), cut into small piece (½ to ¾-inch pieces)
Salt and black pepper
lemon juice
½ cup chopped fresh parsley leaves
Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark
INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.
In a large Dutch Oven, heat ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until tender, stirring occasionally (about 5 mins). Then add the garlic, cumin, and oregano. Cook another 2 mins, stirring regularly, until fragrant.
Add tomatoes, water, bay leaf, beans, and potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Raise the heat and bring to a high simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Cover and transfer to the heated oven. Cook until the sauce slightly thickens, and the beans and potatoes can easily be cut with side of your fork; about 35 minutes or so. (It's a good idea to check once partway through cooking, add a little bit of water if needed.)
Remove from oven and stir in 2 tablespoon lemon juice and chopped fresh parsley. Stir in a generous drizzle of olive oil (at least another ¼ cup).
Serve immediately with Greek pita bread or your favorite rustic bread to sop up the sauce!
NOTES
These green beans are also great as a side dish atop Lebanese rice and next to your favorite protein, chicken kabobs, for example. See more suggestions in the post under ""what to serve with Greek Green Beans.""
Recommended for this recipe our Private Reserve or Early Harvest extra virgin olive oil, from organically grown and processed Koroneiki olives. And organic ground cumin!

I've made Greek Green Beans before but this recipe was so easy and less time at the stovetop! I loved that I could throw it together in my Dutch oven and kick back while it did its thing in the oven! Perfect for a rainy weekend! Flavors were outstanding and I always appreciate that Suzy's recipes allow for leftovers... because, trust me, this is one of those meals you are going to want again the next day! 😋

If you're looking for a healthy egg salad that is anything but average, this recipe is the one for you! Prepared Mediterranean-style, this simple egg salad with avocados, fresh herbs, and crunchy garden veggies is loaded with texture and bright flavor. It will be your new favorite! Low carb and gluten free.

Be sure to read through for tips and ways to serve this healthy egg salad recipe.

Healthy Egg Salad with Avocados, cucumbers, tomoes and fresh herbs
Having spent my college years in the Midwest, I've had my share of cafeteria-style egg salad. You know the kind...mushed egg salad, drowned in mayonnaise.


AD

When I moved out of the dorms into the grown-up apartments across the street, I experimented a little with a healthier version of that egg salad. I simply replaced the mayo with Greek yogurt. Added more celery for extra crunch. Plus some fresh herbs for better flavor.

But, I have finally arrived at a healthy egg salad I can totally stand behind. An egg salad with a bright Mediterranean twist. Loaded with texture, color, and flavor. No heavy mayonnaise to mask the eggs. And no, in this recipe, we don't just use Greek yogurt to healthify it the egg salad.

Here, simply seasoned hard boiled eggs are combined with herbs and other fresh favorites including avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers and red onions.

A beautiful composed egg salad that is truly more than the sum of its parts!

And if you've ever wondered, ""how to make egg salad healthy?""  This fun Mediterranean twist on egg salad is your answer! And how beautiful does it look?!


AD

Ingredients for healthy egg salad, Mediterranean-style. Eggs, avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers and fresh herbs
What's in this Healthy Egg Salad? 
I'll say right now that this egg salad is not only low-calorie and a low carb egg salad, but it's also on my list of Mediterranean diet recipes, and for good reason!


AD

Let's dig into what's in this healthy salad and the fun Mediterranean twist.

There are a couple of components to this somewhat ""composed"" salad:
1- Hard-boiled eggs (the base of the egg salad) 

Here, the beautiful hard boiled eggs shine as the star ingredient--we don't mush them up, and no heavy mayonnaise to drown them.


AD
Instead, hard-boiled eggs are quartered and simply seasoned with a little sweet Aleppo pepper and sumac, adding wonderful depth, some tang, and a very little bit of heat, without overwhelming the eggs (you can find Aleppo pepper and sumac at our online shop.)

Then, we add a good handful of parsley, fresh mint, and a drizzle of  extra virgin olive oil--a gentle mix to combine.

For all our tips and tricks to the best hard-boiled eggs, including the best way to peel and store them, check out our How to Boil Eggs essential guide.

2. Avocados, tomatoes, and cucumbers (the fresh toppings) 

While the herbed egg mixture serves as the base of this healthy egg salad. The second component of this composed salad is a beautiful combination of fresh ingredients-- avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a bit of chopped onions (you can use shallots, if you like.)


AD
And again, I give these ingredients a mix with a bit of my Aleppo pepper and sumac, extra virgin olive oil, and a squeeze of lemon juice.

I love to serve this layered salad on a beautiful platter, starting with the egg mixture at the bottom and my fresh avocado, tomato, and cucumber salad on top.

Now you see that this Mediterranean-style egg salad is not your average. Every bite does have the little bit of that creamy satisfaction from eggs and avocados, coupled with bright and fresh flavors from herbs, tomatoes and cucumbers.


AD
Here's How to Make This Egg Salad
Step 1: Prepare the Eggs and Season Them
Make hard boiled eggs the way you prefer. I typically boil them stove-top and let them sit, covered, for 10 minutes or so (more on this below.) Peel the eggs. (Be sure your hard boiled eggs are completely cooled before using in this recipe.)

Eggs mixed with spices, olive oil and fresh herbs
Slice the eggs into quarters (or wedges). Add them to a mixing bowl. Season eggs with kosher salt, pepper, 1 ½ teaspoon Aleppo pepper and ½ teaspoon sumac. Add fresh herbs and drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (I used Early Harvest Greek extra virgin olive oil).

Toss gently to combine, then transfer to a serving platter.

Seasoned eggs with fresh herbs on serving platter
Step 2: Prepare Fresh Ingredients: Avocados, Tomatoes and Cucumbers 
Clean the mixing bowl (or in a separate bowl), add tomatoes, cucumbers, and diced avocados. Add chopped onions. Season with kosher salt, pepper, 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper and ½ tsp sumac. Add lemon juice and drizzle extra virgin olive oil. Toss to combine.

Avocados, tomatoes, and cucumbers in a bowl 
Step 3: Assemble Egg Salad
Add the dressed veggies on top of the eggs. Give everything a gentle toss. Set aside for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!

How to Boil Eggs for Egg Salad?
Hard boiled eggs are the star of this salad. I know some cook their hard boiled eggs in an Instant Pot, but I have always used this stove-top method and it works every single time. Here is how:

1. Arrange eggs in one single layer in the bottom of a saucepan. Cover with water by about 2 inches or so.

2. Heat the pot over high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil  (add about ½ teaspoon of salt to water to help prevent eggs from cracking and to make them easier to peel.)

3. Turn heat off. Cover and let sit for about 10 to 12 minutes or so for hard boiled eggs. If you prefer your eggs softer and more creamy, remove them from the water at about 6 yo 7 minutes.

AD
How to Peel the Eggs Perfectly?
I've heard that slightly older eggs are easier to boil and peel. So I guess, buy your eggs a few days before you are ready to make this recipe.

For the easiest way to peel your hard boiled eggs this is what I do. Once the eggs are ready, immediately pour off the hot water, leaving the eggs in the pot. Gently shake the eggs in the pot back and forth to lightly crack the shells. Add cold water and a few ice cubes and let sit until cool enough to handle (about 15 minutes.) Peel the eggs and proceed with the recipe.

Can you prepare this Egg Salad in advance?
Meal prep mavens are always looking for ways to get a head start. I don't blame you! You can prepare parts of this low carb egg salad in advance, but assemble a few minutes before serving. Here is how:


AD
Boil eggs in advance. I usually do this one night in advance. Let eggs cool completely and store in the fridge.
Prepare vegetables and herbs. Chop parsley and mint. Slice tomatoes and dice the cucumbers...etc. Wait on the avocado though, you don't want it to change colors and turn brown. Store the veggies in the fridge in a tight-lid glass container and do not mix them. Do not add spices, olive oil or lemon juice until later.
A few minutes before you are ready to serve, mix the eggs with the fresh herbs, spices and extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to a beautiful serving platter.  Then, mix the veggies, avocados, spices, extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice. Add the veggies on top of the eggs. Serve (if you do this a few minutes before serving, this allows a bit of time for flavors to marry.)
How to Serve Mediterranean-Style Healthy Egg Salad?
This fun Mediterranean twist on egg salad may have you thinking, how do I serve this egg salad?

The answer is, there is really no right or wrong way to serve it.  Here are a couple of ideas:

For brunch, serve this egg salad as is on a beautiful platter next to things like falafel, tabouli salad, tzatziki sauce or hummus. Add homemade pita chips to go along!
Serve it in lettuce wraps for an easy low-carb lunch.
And yes, you can absolutely slap it on top of your favorite piece of whole wheat or whole grain toast.

Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark
INSTRUCTIONS
Peel hard boiled eggs and slice them into quarters.
Place sliced eggs in a mixing bowl. Season with a pinch of kosher salt, black pepper, and about 1 ½ teaspoon of the Aleppo chili pepper. Throw in fresh parsley and mint, and add a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Toss to combine.  Transfer seasoned eggs to a serving platter. Clean the mixing bowl to use again.
Place tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado, chopped red onions in the mixing bowl. Season with kosher salt, black pepper, ½ teaspoon Aleppo pepper and ½ teaspoon sumac. Add lemon juice and drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Toss to combine.
Top the eggs with the chopped salad. Serve at room temperature or chill for a few minutes.
NOTES
Cook's Tips: Hard boiled eggs need to be fully cooled before using in this recipe. You can boil the eggs ahead of time (1 night in advance).
How to Boil Eggs on Stovetop: Arrange eggs in one layer in a saucepan. Cover with water by about 2 inches or so. Heat the pot over high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil  (add about ½ teaspoon of salt to water to help prevent eggs from cracking and to make them easier to peel.) Turn heat off Cover and let sit for about 10 to 12 minutes or so for hard boiled eggs. You can remove the eggs earlier (at 6 or 7 minutes) if you prefer them a bit soft and creamier in the center.
Prepare Ahead Option. If you want to prepare parts of this salad ahead of time, you can. I don't prefer to mix the eggs and veggies until a few minutes before serving though. You can certainly boil the eggs in advance. You can also prep the different veggies for the salad about 1 day or so in advance. Wait on the avocado and hold spices, olive oil and lemon juice. When you are ready to serve, dress the salad and follow recipe instructions for assembling.
Leftovers. If you have leftovers of this healthy egg salad, already mixed with the veggies, you can store it in the fridge in a tight-lid container for 1 night. Enjoy cold or at room temperature.

Question?
The recipe calls for 1 tsp sumac, divided.
Instructions say to mix 1/2 tsp sumac with the tomatoes, cucumbers etc.
Where does the other 1/2 tsp sumac go? I assume it's on the eggs?

Egg-free Paleo breakfast recipes are my favorite to make. Especially when doing a Whole30 egg-free breakfasts just have to happen at some point for me. They’re easy to throw together, quick to cook, and I swear they get better when you have them the day after. What makes me love skillets even more is that they double as a one pan meal. My favorite! This bacon and veggie egg-free Paleo breakfast is no exception. And hey, you can always put an egg on it!

Bacon and Veggie Egg-Free Paleo Breakfast Skillet: Paleo, Whole30, Easy Meal Prep. Perfect egg free breakfast if you can't stand to look at another egg on your Whole30. It's a family friendly breakfast recipe that takes less than 20 minutes! #whole30breakfast #eggfreebreakfast #paleobreakfast via @paleobailey

I like to squeeze the juice from half a lemon into this one. It just makes the whole thing taste so fresh and brings all of the flavors together. I know it doesn’t sound normal for a breakfast skillet, but just trust me on this one. Try it once. I’m willing to bet you’ll love it!

I use red pepper in this skillet most of the time, but I’ve definitely made it with green pepper too. Red peppers are a bit sweeter, but if all you’ve got on hand is a green pepper that’s starting to look sad in the fridge, go ahead and use that one up!

One of the other awesome things about egg-free Paleo breakfast recipes (aside from the love letter I wrote to them at the top), is that really you can add any veggies you have. Or even any meat you have. I’ve made this with ground pork, subbed the spinach for broccoli, you name it. It’s one of my favorite ways to clean out the fridge and still make an edible meal.

When my boyfriend meal preps this Whole30 egg free breakfast, he will throw a hardboiled egg into each individual container. Unlike me, he totally loves eggs and enjoys them every which way. So there’s an idea for meal prepping this meal for you. Also, because the breakfast skillet is already made, it would be a good option for busy mornings because frying an egg would only take a few minutes. It would probably even be ready in the time it took to microwave the breakfast skillet for you to throw the egg on top of!

Hi, Sally! The potatoes do take 15 minutes, you’re correct! I think you misread the recipe as it states: “ONCE potatoes start softening, add in onion, pepper, dill, salt and pepper. Let cook 3-4 minutes until PEPPERS are tender”

So happy to find something egg free!!! But as I am just trying to modify eating patterns and do not really “do” Paleo or Whole 30 (more like Whole 28.5), I made some modifications.
First, I used uncured bacon about 6 slices and removed half of the bacon grease. Sauteed the pepper and onion a bit in the bacon grease before adding the potato. Substituted fresh hash brown potatoes (Simply Potatoes which are packaged and available in dairy sections for the potato.) Oh so good. And finally added the bacon at the very end so it would retain its crispiness.

This was so fabulous! Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is so visually appealing too. And the squeeze of fresh lemon was the perfect touch. I’ll be making this pretty often. It’s enough for breakfast the next day too, and I’m betting it will heat up awesomely and be even better.

This is DELICIOUS!! Even my picky kid liked it, and that’s saying a ton. We aren’t doing full-on Whole 30 so I added a tiny bit of cheese on top and let it melt. Heaven! Thank you for an amazing, eggless breakfast recipe (3/4 of us are allergic to eggs in our house and we get SOOO tired of sweet breakfasts)!

This was so yummy! I was so excited to make this and it definitely was worth it. This will be my healthy go-to breakfast from now on. I will say, I think one package of bacon was a lot for this and maybe add more than 1 large potato but this recipe is super flexible. Another thing I noticed was in the ingredients it says garlic powder, but I didn’t see in the instructions where to add it so I just threw it in with the salt in pepper.
Thank you for posting this!! I love breakfast but I hate eggs so this is so perfect for me!

As strange as it sounds I have had a dream about this breakfast hash – and not while I was on a Whole30! I love that it is a great template and you can swap out the veggies as needed. I haven’t yet swapped out the bacon but I’m sure it’s just a matter of time!

Egg-free Paleo breakfast recipes are my favorite to make. Especially when doing a Whole30 egg-free breakfasts just have to happen at some point for me. They’re easy to throw together, quick to cook, and I swear they get better when you have them the day after. What makes me love skillets even more is that they double as a one pan meal. My favorite! This bacon and veggie egg-free Paleo breakfast is no exception. And hey, you can always put an egg on it!

Bacon and Veggie Egg-Free Paleo Breakfast Skillet: Paleo, Whole30, Easy Meal Prep. Perfect egg free breakfast if you can't stand to look at another egg on your Whole30. It's a family friendly breakfast recipe that takes less than 20 minutes! #whole30breakfast #eggfreebreakfast #paleobreakfast via @paleobailey

I like to squeeze the juice from half a lemon into this one. It just makes the whole thing taste so fresh and brings all of the flavors together. I know it doesn’t sound normal for a breakfast skillet, but just trust me on this one. Try it once. I’m willing to bet you’ll love it!

I use red pepper in this skillet most of the time, but I’ve definitely made it with green pepper too. Red peppers are a bit sweeter, but if all you’ve got on hand is a green pepper that’s starting to look sad in the fridge, go ahead and use that one up!

egg-free paleo breakfast

One of the other awesome things about egg-free Paleo breakfast recipes (aside from the love letter I wrote to them at the top), is that really you can add any veggies you have. Or even any meat you have. I’ve made this with ground pork, subbed the spinach for broccoli, you name it. It’s one of my favorite ways to clean out the fridge and still make an edible meal.

When my boyfriend meal preps this Whole30 egg free breakfast, he will throw a hardboiled egg into each individual container. Unlike me, he totally loves eggs and enjoys them every which way. So there’s an idea for meal prepping this meal for you. Also, because the breakfast skillet is already made, it would be a good option for busy mornings because frying an egg would only take a few minutes. It would probably even be ready in the time it took to microwave the breakfast skillet for you to throw the egg on top of!

My fiance and I love to cook together and we are always on the hunt for the next best recipe. We were looking for egg-free options at the time we came across this one and absolutely fell in love. My swapped out potatoes for sweet potatoes and I like to add avocado. It is absolutely heavenly! This is our all-time favorite breakfast recipes out of many that we make.

The potatoes do not cook in 3-4 minutes… more like 15-20! This recipe is very misleading.

Hi, Sally! The potatoes do take 15 minutes, you’re correct! I think you misread the recipe as it states: “ONCE potatoes start softening, add in onion, pepper, dill, salt and pepper. Let cook 3-4 minutes until PEPPERS are tender”

So happy to find something egg free!!! But as I am just trying to modify eating patterns and do not really “do” Paleo or Whole 30 (more like Whole 28.5), I made some modifications.
First, I used uncured bacon about 6 slices and removed half of the bacon grease. Sauteed the pepper and onion a bit in the bacon grease before adding the potato. Substituted fresh hash brown potatoes (Simply Potatoes which are packaged and available in dairy sections for the potato.) Oh so good. And finally added the bacon at the very end so it would retain its crispiness.

Home » Europe » German Recipes » Flammkuchen (French – German Pizza) Flammkuchen (French – German Pizza)


			By: Author Sarah - Curious Cuisiniere 
Posted on Last updated: March 22, 2022


Home » Europe » German Recipes » Flammkuchen (French – German Pizza)

When most people think pizza, they think Italy, but Flammkuchen (also called Flammekueche or tarte flambé in French), the crispy and smoky pizza from the France / Germany border, is definitely worth your time!

We do love a big slice of saucy, mozzarella-laden, classic, Italian pizza. But, it’s also fun to explore the way that pizza has taken on a life of its own in regions outside of Italy.
Like this specialty of Alsace, France and southwestern Germany: Flammkuchen (sometimes spelled Flammenkuchen in German and known as Flammekueche or tarte flambé in Alsace, France).
What is Flammkuchen?

Translated ‘flame cake,’ flammkuchen really aren’t pizza at all, in their own right. They were originally used by bakers to test the temperature of their ovens. A bit of dough was taken and rolled flat, topped with crème fraîche, and baked in the wood-fired bread oven for a few minutes.
The amount of time it took for the flammkuchen to bake to nearly-blistered crispness told them the oven’s temperature. If the flammkuchen came out just right, then the ovens were ready to bake their bread!
This baker’s oven test became a hit, and now can be found made with numerous toppings of its own!
Is Flammkuchen French or German? 
Flammkuchen (pronounced flam-KOOK-en) in German, or Flammekueche (pronounced flam-KOOCHE) or tarte flambé in French, comes from the Alsace region of France (just across Germany’s the southwestern border with France).
The Alsace region, while currently a part of France, has bounced back and forth under German and French control through the centuries. So, understandably, there is a lot of German influence in this region, and a lot of Alsatian, French influence on the German side across the border. 
You will find this specialty on both sides of the current border. It is thought that it originated as Flammekueche (tarte flambé) with bakers in Alsace. (But, when it originated, and whether Alsace was a part of France or Germany at that time, is up for debate.)

Crispy Thin Crust Pizza
Thin and crispy crust pizza lovers, this pizza is for you!
Flammkuchen is characterized by its incredibly thin, crisp, and blistered crust.
We’re talking cracker-like here folks.
What Is Crème Fraîche?
Rather than a tomato sauce, the dough for flammkuchen is spread with crème fraîche (KREHM fresh), a thick, French, soured cream.
Crème fraîche is less sour than American sour cream, so if you can’t find crème fraîche, we recommend using plain, strained yogurt. (Yogurt is naturally thinner than crème fraîche, so we strain it through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to thicken it to a more proper consistency.)
When the crème bakes with the crust, it creates a slightly tart, creamy contrast to the crust’s crispness.

Bacon and Caramelized Onion German Pizza
While you can use any toppings that you like for you flammkuchen, the most traditional combination includes bacon and caramelized onions. These are seasoned only with a bit of nutmeg and black pepper.
Other common variations include

gruyère (or Swiss) cheese
mushrooms
Munster cheese

You can even find sweet versions of flammkuchen that are typically made with apples, cinnamon, and a sweet liqueur.
We went for the classic caramelized onion and bacon version today. Because, really, how can you go wrong with those toppings?
Crisp, creamy, smoky, with a hind of caramelized sweetness.
This pizza makes for a perfect light dinner or appetizer.

Our Flammkuchen Recipe
As far as making pizza goes, this flammkuchen recipe is fairly straightforward.
The dough is a simple mixture of flour, salt, water, and oil that mixes together well and kneads nice and smooth. (Kneading to a smooth dough is important because you want your dough to be able to stretch out nice and thin.)
While the dough rests, it’s time to prepare the toppings. 

Mix the crème fraîche and nutmeg for your ‘sauce’.
Saute up some bacon. 
Caramelize some onions in the bacon grease. 

Then, it’s time to stretch the dough. We like to stretch it right onto a baking sheet, that way once it is stretched, we don’t have to move it and risk tearing the dough.
Finally top and bake ’till crispy!

Pizza around the world has taken on some fun twists. If you’re a pizza lover, give these other variations a try too!

Flammkuchen (German Pizza)

When most people think pizza, they think Italy, but Flammkuchen, the crispy and smoky thin crust German pizza, is definitely worth your time!




Prep Time
40 minutes 


Cook Time
15 minutes 


Total Time
55 minutes 


 
Ingredients
For the Dough


						2 c unbleached all-purpose flour					

						½ tsp salt					

						½ c water					

						2 Tbsp olive oil					

For the Toppings


						1 c crème fraîche, or 1 c Greek yogurt, or slightly over 1 c plain yogurt, strained *					

						¼ tsp nutmeg					

						¼ lb bacon, diced					

						2 onions, halved and sliced thin					

						ground black pepper (to top)					

						Cornmeal (for the pan)					




Instructions
Preheat your oven to 500F. In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, water, and oil. Mix until a dough begins to form, the turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it is soft and smooth, 3-5 min. Set the dough aside and cover it with a towel. In a small bowl, mix together crème fraîche and nutmeg. Set aside. In a large sauté pan, sauté bacon over medium high heat, until it is cooked about halfway to crisp, 2-4 minutes. Remove the bacon (keeping the grease in the pan) to a paper towel lined plate. Set aside. Place the sliced onions into the hot bacon grease and sauté over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, 10 min. Remove the pan from the heat. Roll and stretch the dough out into a rectangle, roughly 11x16 inches. Place the dough onto a large baking sheet that has been generously dusted with cornmeal. Spread the crème fraîche mixture over the crust, leaving just a little bare crust border. Distribute the caramelized onions over the crème fraîche, and sprinkle the bacon over the onions. Finish everything off with a dusting of black pepper. Place the baking sheet with the pizza into the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the pizza is crisp and the edges are starting to darken. Remove from the oven, cut, and serve immediately with some good wine.  

Notes

*To strain your yogurt, place it in a couple layers of cheesecloth in a fine mesh sieve over a bowl for 20-30 minutes.Want to convert to WEIGHT measurements? Have a look at our ingredient conversion guide.

How many days can you leave the dough in the refrigerator before using?

Hi Jackie. You could refrigerate the dough for a day or two before using, if necessary.

Hi, I’m Wondering if this could be made a day or 2 ahead and reheated? Want to make for our families German day party! Thanks In advance, Can’t wait to try!

Hi Dawne. In our experience, flammkuchen leftovers do reheat fairly well in a toaster oven. But, it's still not quite as good as fresh from the oven. (You just can't quite get that fresh from the oven crisp while maintaining the creaminess of the crème fraîche when re-heating.) You could make your dough ahead of time, and keep it wrapped in plastic or in an air-tight container in the refrigerator until a few hours before you are ready to use it. You could also, pre-cook the bacon and the onions and mix your crème fraîche mixture all ahead of time. That way you would just need to roll out your dough, top, and bake before serving. And, you would still be enjoying it fresh and crispy from the oven.

For a suggestion...saute the leaves if Swiss Chard, add to the bacon and onions.  Top with the Swiss Cheese.  Also, use the Roggenbrot recipe for the crust....
